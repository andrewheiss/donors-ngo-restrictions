   The past two decades have seen a proliferation of laws targeted at non-governmental organizations (NGOs), resulting in an increasingly restricted space for these organizations to provide services or engage in advocacy. How do Western donors respond to this legal crackdown on NGOs? We use original data on civil society restrictions across all official aid recipients from 1981–2012 to assess the impact of these restrictions on total flows of foreign aid, how aid is distributed, and which issues are funded. We find that additional legal barriers on NGO political advocacy decrease the amount of foreign given to restrictive countries. Additionally, we find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries and decrease funding for politically sensitive causes in favor of tamer issues that are more compatible with the governments of those countries. Finally, we find that donors—USAID in particular—channel more aid to domestic rather than foreign NGOs in order to assuage target country concerns about external interference in domestic politics. The implications of these findings are worrisome for both Western donors, which channel a large amount of foreign aid through NGOs, and for NGOs, many of which are unable to sustain themselves without financial support from abroad.

In 2013, an Egyptian court imposed jail sentences on 43 non-governmental organization (NGO) employees for failing to comply with the country's civil society organization (CSO) law, which required all NGOs to obtain approval from the Ministry of Social Solidarity before receiving funds from any foreign sources [@egypt-ngos-afp:2012]. Similarly, in 2014, the Indian government cancelled the licenses of over 9,000 NGOs, including prominent international NGOs (INGOs) such as the Ford Foundation and Greenpeace, with the aim of targeting all nonprofits receiving money from foreign sources and prohibiting those whose activities were "political" in nature [@India9000]. The use of restrictive anti-NGO laws is not unique to the cases of Egypt and India. The last two decades have seen a proliferation of laws designed to limit the influence of civil society organizations—as of 2017, more than 100 countries have obstructed, repressed, or completely closed the allowable legal space for civil society [@CIVICUS:2017]. While recent literature has examined the causes behind state crackdown on NGOs [@carothers2014; @DPR2016; @Chaudhry:2016; @Heiss:2017], the consequences of this phenomenon have been relatively unexplored [@DupuyPrakash:2018]. What is the effect of state crackdown on NGOs via these legal restrictions on donors and foreign aid patterns? 

By examining all 140 countries that received some form of foreign aid from 1981–2012, we find that donors systematically respond to changes in the regulatory environment for NGOs. In particular, we look at the impact of anti-NGO regulation on (1) the amount of committed aid, (2) the proportion of aid designated for contentious, politically sensitive purposes, and (3) the proportion of aid channeled through domestic (i.e. local) and international NGOs working in recipient countries. Overall, we find that donors respond to domestic crackdowns on NGOs by scaling back their operations and reducing total aid commitments. We find that additional legal barriers to NGO political advocacy decrease the amount of official development assistance (ODA) channeled to countries. However, instead of a complete withdrawal and scaling back, donors also respond in two main ways. First, we find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries, decreasing funds for politically sensitive causes in favor of tamer issues that are more compatible with the governments of those countries. Second, in order to assuage concerns about foreign NGOs acting as a vehicle for external interference in domestic politics, donors—in particular the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)—channel more aid through domestic NGOs and significantly decrease aid disbursed through foreign NGOs. Our results challenge existing conceptions of foreign aid, wherein such assistance is often considered to be on autopilot for decades, without considering the political contexts of their target countries [@Brainard2007; @Carothers2015, 64].

Understanding the impact of NGO crackdown on donors and funding agencies is vital for three reasons. First, international donors channel a large amount of aid to developing countries via NGOs. In states with poor governance records, donors prefer non-governmental mechanisms for transferring aid [@Dietrich2013], as this avoids problems such as corruption and incompetence and prevents rent-seeking among local elites [@Easterly2006; @gibson2005]. US and Western European democracy promotion agencies and private donors also allocate large amounts of aid to NGOs overseas [@Smith:2000]. By imposing restrictions such as tougher barriers to entry for foreign-funded NGOs, prohibiting the operation of foreign-funded NGOs, and the prohibition of political activities by NGOs, restrictive states may deter donors. This crackdown can consequently lead to a decline in services offered to citizens in developing countries.

Second, both foreign aid and democracy aid is often considered unresponsive to developments on the ground [@Brainard2007; @Carothers2015, 64]. In particular, Carothers suggests that democracy aid allocation is often on "autopilot", which he describes as, "carrying out many types of programs in one setting with little careful thought about which among them offer the most fruitful avenues for change" [-@Carothers2015, 25]. However, our results show that this is not the case—donors systematically respond to changes in the regulatory environment of the organizations implementing their goals. Thus, we document and explain donor responsiveness, particularly how donors can strategically shift funds both within and across recipient countries.

Third, our results have worrying implications for the prospects of democratization, especially in developing countries. Robust civic associations are often seen as a crucial component for healthy democracies [@Putnam1994]. To this end, many nations channel a large amount of democracy assistance towards civil society every year [@Smith:2000]. However, recent research has shown that recipient countries often see such assistance as Western intervention in domestic politics and consequently enact anti-NGO laws [@DPR2016]. Our paper shows that such laws are actually achieving their goals of limiting ability of these organizations to procure funds and carry out their operations, which may eventually force a number of NGOs to shut down. This, in turn, adversely affects the agendas of both the foreign aid and democracy promotion community.

Below, we first examine the existing literature on foreign aid and NGOs. While this literature focuses extensively on the politics of donor countries, the politics of recipient countries—especially with regard to their laws governing civil society—remains unexplored. We then elaborate on our theory regarding the effects of restrictive NGO legislation on bilateral and multilateral donors, the nature of activities funded, and the kinds of targets that receive these funds. We test our hypotheses through a large-*N* statistical analysis by looking at changes in aid across 140 countries from 1981–2012. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings.


# Foreign aid, civil society, and restrictions on NGOs

Foreign aid by Western states to developing countries via bilateral and multilateral official development assistance (ODA) became a booming industry starting in the 1960s. Previous work has documented the importance of material resources in the form of grants, contracts, subsidies from states, and foundations, in explaining the growth and proliferation of NGOs all across the world [@Reimann2006, 48]. Foreign aid has thus been steadily increasing—net ODA increased by 63% during 2000–10, reaching \$128.5 billion by 2010 [@LMP2015, 295]. In 2012, USAID spent approximately \$4.3 billion on assistance to civil society around the world, while the World Bank spent approximately \$11 million on the same in 2009 [@tierney2011].

While NGOs may be the preferred actor of the international community, states do not necessarily view the proliferation and spread of NGOs as a positive development. Many states, in fact, have enacted legal restrictions against NGOs, making it increasingly difficult for NGOs to carry out their operations and survive in the restrictive countries. According to data from the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, between 2004–10, more than 50 countries enacted measures restricting civil society [@Rutzen:2015, 3]. More broadly, between 1990–2012, 79 developing countries introduced severe barriers to entry for NGOs, and 69 countries imposed some form of funding restriction on NGOs—whether in terms of limiting foreign funding or requiring that all money towards NGOs be channeled through government banks [@Chaudhry:2016]. By 2017, the majority of the world has seen a constriction of civic space (see @fig:civicus). According to CIVICUS, only 26 countries have completely unrestricted civic space, while more than 100 have obstructed, repressed, or completely closed the allowable legal space for civil society [@CIVICUS:2017]. 

![CIVICUS Monitor civic space ratings, 2017](Output/fig-civicus-map.pdf){#fig:civicus}

Recent research analyzing the causes behind this crackdown has argued that, in many cases, foreign funding to these groups is seen as providing resources to political opponents and allows foreign governments to interfere in their domestic affairs [@DPR2016; @carothers2014; @mendelson2015]. More broadly, @Chaudhry:2016 finds that while violent crackdown is useful against NGOs posing immediate threats, states cannot use violence against all NGOs, as doing so may reduce the state's legitimacy, violate human rights treaties, increase the state's criminal liability, and further mobilize the population against the regime. Therefore, in the long-term, states prefer restrictive NGO legislation since they overcome the negative consequences associated with violence.

It is important to note that not all NGO-related legislation is necessarily aimed at restricting NGOs. Laws and regulations establish standards for appropriate individual or organizational behavior and set penalties for violations [@North1990]. Governments frequently use regulations to routinize the behavior of NGOs—regulations produce convergent practices and reduce uncertainty in the future [@BloodgoodTB, 145] and prevent malfeasance that threatens to undermine confidence in the entire NGO community [@GibelmanGelman; @ONeill2009]. Standard regulations requiring mandatory registration for NGOs, filing reports of their annual activities and funding sources help prevent the spread of "briefcase NGOs," or organizations that exist only on paper and provide little to no service. Standard regulations can also increase organizational rights and improve access to the policy-making process [@btb2016; @Teets2014]. Thus, regulatory barriers are not inherently negative and can have a positive impact. 

In this article, however, we focus primarily on the impact of restrictive regulations or anti-NGO laws. Unlike regulations aimed at standardizing state–NGO relations, these laws are intended to have a negative impact on the NGO community by creating deliberate barriers to their entry, funding, and advocacy. *Barriers to entry* refers to the use of law to discourage, burden, or prevent the formation of NGOs. For instance, in many states, mandatory registration requirements are rarely straightforward: approval times are lengthy, there are vague criteria for registration, NGOs may not be allowed appeals in denied registration, and some countries require an unreasonably large number of founders or funds in order to register [@Chaudhry:2016; @Heiss:2017]. 

*Barriers to funding* refers to the use of law to restrict the ability of NGOs to secure the financial resources necessary to carry out their work. States seek to impose restrictions on NGOs based on the origin of funds, how those funds are channeled, and which issues these funds can be used towards. Barriers to foreign funding have become the most pervasive form of legislative crackdown against NGOs. These funding restrictions are particularly worrisome because citizens in many countries are often too poor to support local NGOs, may lack a culture of philanthropic giving, or may prefer to channel funds to groups working in non-contentious areas such as health and education [@DPR2015; @RPC:2016; @Brechenmacher:2017]. Even when domestic donors wish to donate to NGOs working in contentious areas, they are often deterred by dismal tax incentives, threats to take away business permits, or have a general fear of retribution [@HudsonInstitute:2015; @Baoumi:2016]. 

Finally, *barriers to advocacy* refers to the use of laws to restrict NGOs from engaging in the full range of free expression and public policy advocacy. Such laws prevent organizations from carrying out legitimate activities by placing burdens on speech and publication, and the use of defamation laws. These laws also bar NGOs from working on political issues, where "political" is intentionally vaguely defined in order to provide an easy cover for governments to crack down on NGOs they perceive as politically threatening. These laws can allow repressive regimes to simultaneously reap the benefits of foreign NGOs—such as policy expertise, aid, and humanitarian services—to improve governance and ensure regime stability, while also offsetting the risks inherent in allowing these organizations to operate [@Heiss:2019]. 


# The impact of restrictive NGO legislation

How does restrictive NGO legislation impact the foreign aid sector and democracy promotion community? In particular, how does it impact donor behavior in regard to the amount and targets of aid? Previous research analyzing determinants of foreign aid has looked at both domestic politics of donor countries [@MilnerTingley2010], as well as the needs of recipient countries [@AlesinaDollar2010; @Dreher2009; @EasterlyPfutze2008]. In studies that look at the impact of recipient country characteristics on the distribution of aid, the effect of recipient governments' respect civil and political rights on the amount of aid that a country receives remain inconclusive [@svensson1999]. @Neumayer:2003 finds that low regulatory burden is statistically significant and substantively strong in determining level of aid for good governance. Respect for personal integrity rights is also insignificant at best and exerts a positive influence on aid eligibility at worst [@poe1992; @PoeTate1994]. Thus, the foreign aid literature remains inconclusive about whether concerns about crackdown on NGOs factor into donor decisions regarding the channeling of foreign aid via non-state actors. 

@DupuyPrakash:2018, looking at the effects of the adoption of restrictive NGO finance laws, find that an additional law is associated with a 32% decline in bilateral aid inflows in subsequent years. On the other hand, multilateral donors and overseas diaspora do not reduce aid in response to such restrictive funding laws. While @DupuyPrakash:2018 concentrate on new laws that restrict the inflow of foreign funds to domestically operating NGOs, we analyze a wide variety of laws beyond barriers to funding, including barriers to association, entry, and advocacy. Further, we not only analyze how donors respond with changes in overall levels of aid to a country, but also how donors systematically shift aid allocations to different sectors, issues and targets within a country depending on the nature of the restrictions being implemented against NGOs. 

Given the wide range of donors and NGOs affected by this global crackdown, we argue that donors (both within the foreign aid and democracy promotion community) can respond to increasingly repressive NGO legislation in two broad ways—they can either scale back their operations, or they can systematically redirect funds within restrictive countries to different causes and actors (and in some cases, both).

## Scaling back

In response to the crackdown on NGOs, we first hypothesize that bilateral and multilateral donors who channel funds via NGOs to developing countries may reduce aid. This is because of three main reasons. First, critics may believe that aid will be effective only if delivered through non-governmental mechanisms [@Easterly2006; @gibson2005; @LMP2015]. Without this option, donors may have to channel funds directly to recipient governments and in doing so, may end up reducing their total aid. 

Second, restrictive NGO legislation can also imply a declining respect for civil and political rights in the target state. Consequently, donors may choose to channel democracy assistance towards civil society groups in countries that are in a better position to utilize these funds. For instance, numerous American, German, and Egyptian NGOs workers were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences in absentia following a high-profile trial from 2011–13. This led many foreign donors who had invested in Egypt after the revolution to withdraw from the country [@Brechenmacher:2017]. Therefore, we can expect to see a decline in bilateral transfers and official development assistance to countries that pass restrictive NGO legislation. 

Finally, donors may reduce their funding to countries enacting restrictive NGO legislation because of the disappearance or reduction of appropriate NGO partners in that country. Dupuy, Ron and Prakash, examining the regulatory offensive against NGOs in Ethiopia, find that legislation against foreign-funded NGOs shut down a majority of the NGOs in the human rights sector in the country [-@DPR2015, 420]. Thus, with fewer NGOs, and in many cases, with the disappearance of trusted NGO partners, donors may hesitate to channel money to remaining NGOs, especially those with whom they have not previously partnered. We thus propose our first hypothesis:

> **H~1~**: If countries adopt restrictive NGO legislation, then bilateral and multilateral donors will reduce foreign aid to those countries.

## Responding to the crackdown

However, it is unlikely that donors always simply scale back their operations when faced with repressive legislation in target countries. In many cases, donors—both state and private—actively work to find solutions and develop responses to help besieged local NGOs in the Global South. Further, as Carothers points out, scaling back is sometimes only visible with the actual departure of funders from the country [-@Carothers:2015, 15]. For instance, following the 2015 Undesirable Organizations Law in Russia, a large number of funding organizations such as the MacArthur Foundation and the National Democratic Institute were asked to leave the country. However, this expulsion was also the culmination of almost a decade-long campaign in Russia that had initially targeted domestic NGOs, and then finally succeeded in getting major rights-based INGOs to exit the country as well. In cases that do not have as high a profile, it is more likely that we should observe subtle changes. We emphasize two such changes. 

First, we expect that donors should change the nature of the causes that they support and the organizations that they work with. Facing greater restrictions on the nature of activities undertaken by NGOs, donors may find it difficult to identify local NGOs that still work on contentious issue areas such as human rights, elections, political parties, youth groups, anti-corruption organizations and institutions, increasing democratic participation, and advocacy. For instance, after the Egyptian NGO trial that sentenced most of the defendants with prison sentences of up to five years, many domestic NGOs which had embraced political work in the aftermath of the revolution abandoned politically-oriented work and instead turned towards less contentious issues [@Brechenmacher:2017].

States themselves also encourage NGOs to undertake work on non-contentious issues. Describing the nature of state-civil society relationships in China, @Teets2014 argues that the Chinese government not just allows, but encourages NGOs working in areas such as public health, education reform, and disaster relief. In doing so, better governance, rather than democratization, is the desired goal. Similarly, the 2009 Ethiopian Charities and Societies Proclamation Act stipulates that NGOs working on any rights issues must acquire 90% of their funding from domestic sources. However, the government refrains from enforcing the law against NGOs that do not challenge the state's development agenda [@Brechenmacher:2017]. Therefore, with increasing state rhetoric against civil society groups that threaten the security and sovereignty of the state, donors may find it more politically appropriate to increase the amount of funding for "tame" causes such as education, health, and social service provision.[^tame] This leads to our second hypothesis:

> **H~2~**: If countries adopt restrictive NGO legislation, then donors will increase aid for tamer causes and reduce aid for politically sensitive causes.

Second, due to constraints on entry and funding for INGOs, donors may instead turn to domestic NGOs in the hope that repressive states view these domestic groups as less suspicious compared to INGOs. Previous research by @Bush2016 has shown that American aid officials strongly prefer American NGOs in implementing programming abroad. This is because American NGOs are easier to observe, are more likely to share donors' preferences, and may also mitigate potential implementation problems, making it easier for donors to monitor progress and receive reports. 

However, we argue there are several reasons why donors might prefer domestic NGOs to international or US-based NGOs in restrictive regulatory environments.[^domestic-international] Official USAID strategy describes many justifications for channeling more aid to domestic NGOs, including increased localization and sustainability [@USAID2013]. Additionally, governments often pass restrictive laws out of a perception of foreign influence in domestic politics [@DupuyPrakash:2018] and relying on domestic organizations can assuage these concerns. Moreover, USAID increases technical assistance to local NGOs in order to help them respond to restrictive regulatory proposals and earmarks specific support for besieged NGOs under USAID's Stand with Civil Society initiative [@USAID2014; @USAID2015; @crs:2016]. Beyond these justifications, @Heiss:2017 finds that it is often more convenient for foreign donors to deal with domestic partners when facing strict registration requirements—shifting to more domestic partners is a common response to more difficult regulations. Given these trends, we thus propose our final hypothesis:

> **H~3~**: If countries adopt restrictive NGO legislation, then donors will channel more aid through domestic NGOs and channel less aid through foreign NGOs. 


# Data and methods

We test these hypotheses by analyzing how patterns of foreign aid commitments and allocation have changed in response to restrictive anti-NGO legislation. We combine variables from several existing datasets and create a cross-sectional time series panel that includes information about aid and NGO legislation in 140 countries from 1981–2012.[^7] Summary statistics for all the variables we use in our models are provided in @tbl:var-summary in the appendix.

## Dependent variables

We measure foreign aid using the OECD's detailed data on aid commitments, which includes all overseas development assistance (ODA) from OECD member countries and multilateral organizations. Following guidance from the OECD,[^oecd] we use *commitment* amounts rather than actual *disbursement* amounts since disbursement data moves slowly and does not necessarily reflect responses to the political environment—projects take a long time to fulfill and actual inflows of aid in a year can be tied to commitments made years before. Because we are interested in donor reactions to restrictions on NGOs, any reaction would be visible in the decision to commit money to aid, not in the ultimate disbursement of aid, which is already legally obligated and allocated to the country regardless of changes in civil society restrictions. For our first hypothesis, we calculate the sum of OECD-based ODA committed to each country each year since 1981 (in constant 2011 US dollars), representing nearly \$5.5 trillion in total assistance (see the top left panel of @fig:dvs). 

![**Top left (H~1~)**: total overseas development assistance (ODA) committed to all countries; **top right (H~2~)**: proportion of OECD ODA committed to contentious programs; **bottom left**: total US foreign aid committed to all countries; **bottom right (H~3~)**: proportion of US foreign aid channeled through different types of NGOs](Output/fig-dvs.pdf){#fig:dvs}

Aid data from the OECD includes detailed information about the purposes of each grant or project undertaken, which we use to test our second hypothesis. The OECD assigns projects to one of more than 200 different purpose codes in dozens of broader categories such as health, education, and agriculture. We classify contentious aid as any project focused on government and civil society[^2] or conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security.[^3] While the former includes projects on anti-corruption organizations and institutions, democratic participation and civil society, elections, media, human rights, legal and judicial reform, legislature and political parties, the latter includes security sector reform, civilian peacebuilding, and child soldiers. It is important to note that the latter aid on peace and security does not include military aid. While we recognize that not all projects within categories are outrightly contentious, we have classified them as such based on the assumption that states perceive a majority of programs within these categories as contentious.[^4] These categories also overlap with Bush's definition of categories of democracy assistance that classifies as "not regime compatible" [@Bush:2015, 57]. Nearly \$300 million has been allocated for this more aggressive kind of aid since 1980, accounting for more than 10% of all OECD-based foreign aid since 2009 (see the top right panel of @fig:dvs). 

In our third hypothesis, we posit that more aid will be allocated to domestic NGOs than international or US-based NGOs in response to harsher anti-NGO restrictions. The OECD unfortunately does not uniformly categorize each aid project by delivery channel, which makes it impossible to systematically determine which kinds of organizations receive money from all OECD countries. USAID, on the other hand, offers more granular data about the channels through which aid is delivered. We generate several variables indicating the proportion of American foreign aid channeled through domestic, international, and US-based NGOs. Notably, however, our tests of this hypothesis are based solely on American aid and thus represent only a subset of OECD donor behavior. We consider the total amount of economic aid from 26 different US government agencies in each country annually, as reported in the agency's Green Book, comprising \$519 billion since 1981, and \$248 billion since 2000 (see the bottom left panel of @fig:dvs). As is evident in the bottom right panel of @fig:dvs, almost no aid was allocated to NGOs before 2000—due to changes in reporting standards, nearly all aid reported by USAID was delivered solely by the United States government until 2000. As such, we also limit our analysis to 2000–12, adding additional caveats to the interpretation of this hypothesis.

To capture the lagged effect of each explanatory variable on amount of aid in a given year, we shift our different measures of foreign aid ahead by one year (instead of lagging all the explanatory variables individually). As a robustness check we also include models with aid leaded by two years and five years and find similar results. For the sake of modeling, we transform our measures of aid differently for each hypothesis: when looking at total aid amounts, we take the natural log of aid; when looking at proportions of aid, we use a logit transformation and add or subtract 0.001 from values that are exactly 0 or 1. @eq:all-models-dvs lists the functional forms of the dependent variables for each hypothesis.

## Explanatory variables

To measure restrictive anti-NGO legislation, we use data from @Chaudhry:2016 and @christensen2013, who track the presence or absence of restrictive NGO laws across all countries. We exclude consolidated democracies as these countries are generally the providers of aid and not the recipients of aid (see @tbl:countries in the appendix for a complete list of countries included).[^5] These laws are categorized by purpose and encompass barriers to entry, funding, and advocacy.[^6] We create summative indexes for the laws in each of these categories (see @tbl:ngo-barriers-index). We also show each component of this index over time in three of the panels of @fig:barriers. Because this NGO legislation data indicates only the year of initial appearance of a legal barrier, we carry the inverse of the first known value backwards (e.g. because Albania did not require NGO registration until 2001, it is coded as 0 until that year).

While the main focus of this paper is donor response to formal legislation, we also look at donor response to changes in the de facto implementation of those laws as a robustness check. An alternative method for measuring civil society restrictions is to look at the overall civil society regulatory environment instead of specific laws, since *de jure* legislation does not always reflect the *de facto* restrictions. Actual laws can lie dormant until needed for repression. For instance, Russia passed the Undesirable Organizations law of 2015 with the purpose of targeting and eliminating specific foreign-connected NGOs it deemed dangerous. One of the law's sponsors, Aleksandr Tarnavsky, described the law as a preventative measure that would not affect the majority of NGOs working in Russia. Rather, the law would be a "weapon hanging on the wall… that never fires" and stand as a warning to potentially uncooperative NGOs [@Kozenko:2015]. Simply counting laws therefore misses the effect of their de facto implementation—laws can be benignly routine, dangerously dormant, or outrightly restrictive. 

To address this disconnect, @Heiss:2017 developed a new civil society regulatory environment index (CSRE), which combines two indexes from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project [@VDEM]: (1) civil society repression and (2) civil society entry and exit regulations. The CSRE index ranges from roughly −4 to 4 (with greater values indicating a more open regulatory environment) and shows more variation over time since it ostensibly captures changes in the implementation of the regulatory environment rather than the presence or absence of legislation. The bottom right panel of @fig:barriers shows how the average global CSRE index has changed since 1980. As seen in the figure, democracies have a more open and permissive legal environment for civil society, while non-democracies are more restrictive. Both types of countries saw a rapid expansion of civic space at the end of the Cold War, as states began to add constitutional protections for the freedom of association. Since the mid 1990s, however, the average global level of de facto civil society regulations has been fairly stagnant. Individual countries do show more variation, though, and the variable serves as a helpful sanity check when interpreting our model results.

## Control variables

As explained previously, an active and contentious literature has long debated what determines how much foreign aid donors allocate to countries. Research has found that donors give more to smaller, poorer countries that share former colonial or present diplomatic ties [@Neumayer:2003; @AndersenHansenMarkussen:2006; @MilnerTingley2010], or that suffer from internal conflict, natural disasters, and other unexpected shocks [@Raddatz:2007; @BezerraBraithwaite:2016]. Other factors play less of a role, such as a country's military spending, respect for personal integrity rights, regime type, domestic instability, political ideology, or quality of governance [@Neumayer:2003a; @Neumayer:2003b]. Therefore, we control for four general themes found in previous research: *democracy*, *wealth*, *government capacity*, and *unexpected shocks*. 

We control for the level of *democracy* in a country based on the understanding that donors consider the ability of recipient governments and democratic institutions to utilize aid flows. We measure democratization using data from Polity IV [@PolityIV], rescaled from 0–10, with 10 being most democratic. We also include a binary indicator marking years after 1989 to account for differences in post-Cold War foreign aid. Since we believe that a country's wealth and aid dependence influences donation decisions, we measure a country's *wealth* in two ways: (1) GDP per capita, measured in constant 2011 US dollars, and (2) the amount of trade—both imports and exports—as a percent of GDP. 

An alternative strand in the foreign aid literature argues that the decision to channel money via NGOs or governments is reflective of the funder's belief in the capacity of either actor to get the job done. In countries with weak or corrupt state institutions, donors expect a higher probability of aid capture and consequently want to channel more funds via NGOs [@Dietrich2013]. Given the influence of *government capacity* in donor decision making, we include the political corruption index from V-Dem [@McMannPemsteinSeim:2016], which accounts for public sector, executive, legislative, and judicial corruption, and ranges from 0–10, with 10 being most corrupt. Finally, we include two measures of *unexpected shocks*, based on the idea that more deaths and damages from natural disasters or internal armed conflict may prompt donors to provide aid for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. We measure the occurrence of natural disasters with a binary indicator from the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT) [@EMDAT], marking whether or not a disaster occurred in a given year, and we use data from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict dataset [@gleditsch2002] to indicate the presence of an internal conflict in the past five years.

Foreign aid exhibits serial correlation, since the current year's level of aid is partially dependent on previous commitments. As discussed earlier, research often considers aid policies as running on autopilot, with few changes and little consideration for the political environments of target countries. However, changes in aid commitments still occur, and we hypothesize that these changes happen in response to the imposition of anti-NGO laws. To account for the degree of autopiloted aid that does occur, we include the value of the dependent variable (i.e. aid, proportion of contentious aid, etc.) in the previous year as a final control.[^longer-lags]

## Modeling strategy

Finally, we test our hypotheses using a series of multilevel Bayesian regression models. For each model coefficient, we report the posterior median, the proportion (or probability) of the distribution that is greater than zero, and the 90% credible interval. We declare an effect statistically significant if the median posterior probability that its coefficient is different from zero (or one in odds ratio-based models) is larger than 90%.[^stan] We account for country and year effects to distinguish between natural time-variant and country-specific changes in donor behavior to increased NGO restrictions. Following @BellJones:2015, we use crossed random effects multilevel models for both country and year and decompose each continuous variable into meaned and demeaned forms by calculating the average value of that variable within a country and subtracting that mean from each individual observation. More formally, as seen in @eq:re-within-between, the $\beta_1$ coefficient represents the value for the demeaned variable ($x_{it} - \bar{x}_i$) and corresponds to the time-variant effect of that variable *within* an individual country (i.e. how $x$ influences $y$ over time). $\beta_2$, on the other hand, represents the value for the mean of the variable ($\bar{x}_i$) and corresponds to the time-*in*variant effect of that variable *between* all countries (i.e. how the general level of $x$ is associated with $y$ across all countries). 

$$ y_{i, t + 1} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (x_{it} - \bar{x}_i) + \beta_2 \bar{x}_i + \ldots $$ {#eq:re-within-between}

While this model specification is at first a little unwieldy, it has multiple benefits. The coefficients for demeaned (or *within*) variables in this kind of random effects model are roughly equivalent to their corresponding coefficients in a fixed effects model and are thus generally the coefficients of interest. These coefficients can be interpreted like standard regression coefficients: on average, accounting for differences over time, a unit change in $x_t$ in a given country corresponds to a $\beta_1$ change in $y_{t+1}$. The *between* effects, on the other hand, reflect the cross-sectional variance and do not indicate changes in variable values. Instead, these coefficients show how the average level of each explanatory variable is related to the dependent variable: on average, countries with higher (or lower) $x$ tend to have higher (or lower) $y$. With this specification, our model clearly separates the within from the between effects and retains details about variance between countries and years (a more detailed explanation of this approach is included in the appendix).

# Results and analysis

We present the estimates of our different models in coefficient plots below. Since there are many control variables, and most are doubled up with *within* and *between* effects, we only include variables related to NGO regulations in each plot. The full results of all models are included in the appendix, and @tbl:findings-summary summarizes the main findings for each hypothesis.

## Changes in overall aid

We first look at how anti-NGO legal barriers affect ODA in the following year (see @fig:coefs-h1). The total number of legal barriers generally has a negative effect (though insignificant: $P(\beta < 0) = 0.84$) on foreign aid. When we disaggregate the effect of different types of restrictions, we find that donors respond primarily to the imposition of legal barriers to advocacy. Increasing limitations on advocacy beyond a country's average level is associated with a 43% drop in aid the following year, on average ($P(\beta < 0) = 0.96$). Barriers to entry and barriers to funding do not influence aid, though, and neither do changes in the overall civil society regulatory environment. The *between* effects are also instructive: countries with more legal barriers to entry tend to have higher levels of aid ($P(\beta > 0) = 0.95$), while those with more barriers to funding receive less aid, on average ($P(\beta < 0) = 0.99$). Additionally, countries with a more open de facto CSRE generally receive more aid ($P(\beta > 0) = 0.94$).

![Determinants of OECD ODA in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 90% credible interval.](Output/fig-coefs-h1-bayes.pdf){#fig:coefs-h1}

The substantive impact of these coefficients can be seen in @fig:predicted-h1, which shows the predicted level of foreign aid across 500 draws from the posterior distribution over a range of differences from the average number of NGO barriers in an average country (with all independent variables held at their mean or modal values). Adding an additional barrier to advocacy beyond a country's average can reduce foreign aid commitments by more than $100 million in the following year. Though this amount is minuscule compared to the total amount of global foreign aid, measured in hundreds of billions of dollars (see the top left panel of @fig:dvs), it is sizable given the proportions being channeled as civil society aid. 

![Predicted ODA across a range of differences from average number of anti-NGO laws in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](Output/fig-predicted-h1.pdf){#fig:predicted-h1}

Why might barriers to NGO advocacy be associated with reduced aid while other legal restrictions are not? Barriers to advocacy represent the harshest, most direct restrictions on NGO activity and include government intimidation or dissolution of undesirable organizations. Donors are more responsive to these more direct kinds of restrictions either in an effort to punish recalcitrant countries or because the restricted legal environment makes it more difficult to operate in the country. Unlike more benign bureaucratic legal barriers against funding or registration that are designed to make NGO operations more difficult or inconvenient, overt political intimidation and advocacy restrictions complicate NGO programming, and can even make it legally or politically impossible for donors to carry out certain projects. Given this more restrictive legal environment, international donors in turn reduce their funding commitments.

## Changes in contentiousness of aid

We next turn to the purpose of the committed aid given by OECD donors. We hypothesize that in response to restrictive NGO laws, donors will tame their aid and systematically shift commitments away from more contentious issues like human rights, elections, media, and democratic participation. As described earlier, our dependent variable is the logit-transformed proportion of contentious to non-contentious aid in the following year. The results in @fig:coefs-h2 and in the appendix are reported as odds ratios, but the coefficients are not exactly comparable to odds ratio coefficients from logistic regression and other models based on binary outcomes. Following @TrippKang:2008, who use a similar transformation to model the proportion of women in legislatures, these coefficients represent the percentage change in the ratio of an in-group to an out-group, or the amount of contentious to non-contentious aid. Coefficient values below one indicate less contentious aid; values above one indicate more contentious aid.

![Determinants of the proportion of contentious OECD ODA in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 90% credible interval.](Output/fig-coefs-h2-bayes.pdf){#fig:coefs-h2}

The results from these models tell a somewhat counterintuitive story. Contrary to our hypothesis, the total number of legal barriers to NGOs is associated with an *increase* in contentious aid, with a 4% greater proportion of contentious aid to non-contentious aid, all else equal ($P(\operatorname{e}^\beta > 1) = 0.91$). Decomposing this small effect, we see that barriers to advocacy have a sizable effect on contentious programming—adding a new anti-advocacy barrier is associated with an 80% lower ratio of contentious aid ($P(\operatorname{e}^\beta < 1) = 0.96$). In contrast, donors appear to increase their proportion of contentious programming in response to new barriers to entry (8% higher; $P(\operatorname{e}^\beta > 1) = 0.90$) and funding (13% higher; $P(\operatorname{e}^\beta > 1) = 0.95$), thus offsetting the negative effect generated by new barriers to advocacy. The civil society regulatory environment also plays an important role in the allocation of contentious aid: a one-point improvement in the CSRE index is associated with a 6% higher ratio of contentious aid ($P(\operatorname{e}^\beta > 1) = 0.94$). None of the time-invariant *between* coefficients are substantially associated with the proportion of contentious aid.

Looking at the predicted proportion of contentious aid is helpful, given the difficulty in interpreting a percent change in ratios. @fig:predicted-h2 shows how the predicted proportion of contentious aid changes across a range of differences from both the average number of barriers to advocacy and the average CSRE index, with all other variables again held at their typical values. Adding new legal restrictions on advocacy reduces the amount of contentious aid donors allocate to countries by nearly a percentage point on average (i.e. moving from 3% to 2%). Adding new barriers to entry and funding, though, appears to have an enabling effect on contentious aid, with donors increasing the proportion of their contentious programming by around half a percentage point each (i.e. moving from 2.5% to 3%). 

![Predicted proportion of contentious OECD ODA across a range of differences from average number of anti-NGO laws in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](Output/fig-predicted-h2.pdf){#fig:predicted-h2}

@Bush:2015 argues that donors tame their programming when confronting dictators due to a particular causal chain. Donors increasingly demand measurable programs and results in order to secure ongoing funding from their funding and oversight bodies. As such, both donors and NGOs face risks when engaging in contentious programming—getting shut down or expelled from a country makes it difficult to prove to your sponsor that your program was effective. To reduce these risks (and improve the chances of positive program outcomes), NGO programming naturally becomes tamer. We see a similar trend of taming in our models, but it appears to follow a different chain of events related more to safety than to the impulse to measure programs. The effects for barriers to advocacy and the civil society regulatory environment confirm our hypothesis—donors do indeed appear to tame their programming both when facing political restrictions and when the legal environment for civil society constricts. However, donors increase their contentiousness when facing laws restricting entry and funding, contrary to our hypothesis. This suggests that (1) donors reduce funding for contentious programming when laws are designed specifically to prohibit advocacy-based programming, while (2) donors simultaneously increase funding for contentious issues in the face of less targeted laws, potentially in an effort to counter them. 

There is anecdotal evidence for this assertion: donors and NGOs have actively lobbied against these kinds of legislative efforts in several countries. Following a two-year grassroots campaign, in 2016 a coalition of civil society activists and international donors in Kyrgyzstan—including the Open Society Foundations—helped defeat a bill modeled after Russia's 2012 foreign agent law that prohibited foreign funding and limited access to international NGOs. Activists emphasized that the bill would limit funding to government agencies dependent on aid, and some Kyrgyz legislators cited the need for this funding in their justification for voting against the bill, stating that "We get financial assistance from [international organizations] in many fields, including healthcare, education, and agriculture among others. We need this money."[^kyrgyz] Kenyan activists and international donors undertook a similar campaign in 2013, defeating a law designed to limit funding from foreign sources and impose burdensome registration requirements on organizations in the country.[^kenya] USAID intervened directly in Cambodia in 2011, providing technical assistance to local NGOs who were able to coordinate a strong lobbying effort against the passage of an anti-NGO bill. 

The taming that we see with advocacy is thus born out of concerns of safety and practicality (i.e. if contentious programming is banned outrightly, it is difficult to continue to fund it). We do not see a similar trend in taming with entry and funding laws because these kinds of regulations do not pose as much of a direct threat to programming, and donors may increase funds for contentious programming to defend against these laws.

## Changes in aid channels

Finally, we hypothesize that donors react to anti-NGO legislation by shifting their money away from international or US-based organizations to domestic NGOs, since the latter are less likely to viewed with suspicion by host countries and their citizens. Our dependent variable for this hypothesis is the proportion of aid channeled through domestic and foreign NGOs and is based on US foreign aid data since 2000 rather than all OECD countries since 1981. Coefficients should be interpreted again as the odds ratio of an in-group to an out-group—in this case, the proportion of aid channeled through domestic NGOs (or foreign NGOs) to all other channels.

![Determinants of the proportion of US foreign aid channeled through either domestic or foreign NGOs in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 90% credible interval.](Output/fig-coefs-h3-bayes.pdf){#fig:coefs-h3}

As seen in @fig:coefs-h3, adding an additional legal barrier beyond a country's average level is associated with *more* funding channeled through domestic NGOs, increasing the ratio by an average of 15% ($P(\operatorname{e}^\beta > 1) = 0.99$). This effect seems to be driven primarily by barriers to funding, which is the only category of legal restriction to have a substantial *within* effect. On average, countries that enact an additional barrier to funding beyond their average level of regulation see a 34% higher ratio of aid channeled through domestic NGOs in the following year ($P(\operatorname{e}^\beta > 1) = 0.98$). As would be expected given the increase in the use of domestic NGOs, the model finds that barriers to funding have a reverse effect on the proportion of aid given through foreign NGOs—countries enacting an additional barrier to funding see a 30% average decrease in the proportion of aid given to INGOs ($P(\operatorname{e}^\beta < 1) = 0.99$). However, contrary to our hypothesis, the model also predicts that the imposition of entry laws *increases* the ratio of aid channeled to foreign NGOs by 36% ($P(\operatorname{e}^\beta > 1) = 0.97$). No other NGO-related variables have a consistent effect on how much aid goes through either type of organization. 

@fig:predicted-h3 shows a more substantive representation of these results with the predicted proportion of American aid channeled through domestic and foreign NGOs across different degrees of NGO restrictions. More aid is predicted to go through domestic NGOs as restrictions increase, but the proportion remains minuscule, increasing an average of 0.2% for each additional barrier. This is due, in part, to the fact that the baseline amount of aid channeled through domestic NGOs is inherently small. The predicted proportion of aid given through foreign NGOs, however, is much more marked and substantial. In an average country, the imposition of a new barrier to funding leads to a nearly five percentage point drop in the ratio of funds channeled through foreign NGOs (i.e. moving from 10% to 5%), while a new barrier to funding is associated with an increase of roughly two percentage points (i.e. moving from 10% to 12%).

![Predicted proportion of US foreign aid channeled to domestic and foreign across a range of differences from average number of barriers to funding in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](Output/fig-predicted-h3.pdf){#fig:predicted-h3}

As hypothesized, USAID channels less aid through foreign NGOs and more aid through domestic NGOs in the following the imposition of additional legal barriers to funding. Since repressive governments design these laws to restrict foreign organizations, they appear to be having their intended effect. Additionally, while there is a substitution of aid channeled through foreign NGOs to aid through domestic NGOs, the exchange is not balanced. The rise in funding to domestic NGOs is far more modest than the steep decline in funding through foreign NGOs. This is possible due to two main reasons. First, domestic NGOs may be more discerning when accepting foreign funds, because they in turn face the consequences of receiving this additional money from abroad. Second, USAID may not immediately want to transfer large sums of money to domestic organizations without vetting them first.

Finally, the model predicts that additional laws restricting NGO entry are associated with more USAID funding channeled through foreign NGOs, which goes contrary to our expectations. However, given that entry laws make it harder for domestic NGOs to register, incorporate, or appeal denials to such processes, it could be possible that USAID channels additional funds to foreign organizations that are already in the country. Future research will need to investigate this further.

## Challenges to inference

We face a couple of challenges to inference that we cannot directly account for in our quantitative analysis. First, in the face of legal barriers and a constricted regulatory environment, many NGOs adjust their strategy to maintain their programming. Organizations can remove branding from offices and vehicles, move offices before government inspectors visit, and even leave the country and work on programs from abroad [@Heiss:2017]. Often NGOs can continue their programs unabated while simply framing their missions differently. For instance, after the passage of a 2009 law in Ethiopia that prevented the operation of groups working on human rights issues, one NGO employee commented, "instead of talking about working to stop sexual violence, they will frame their activities as 'helping girls have a better future.'&#8202;" [@EFC2017]. Therefore, it may be possible that NGOs simply frame their programming in more tame terms in order to avoid the ire of their governments, while continuing to implement their actual contentious programing. However, it is unlikely that our results are driven entirely by a change in framing—NGOs working in areas such as democracy promotion or election monitoring may find it more difficult to frame their objectives as benign. Not all organizations can easily reframe their objectives without changing the actual substance of their programming.

Moreover, it is possible that a decline in overall levels of donor funds could be a policy strategy independent of restrictions. In August 2018, for example, the Trump administration imposed caps on the amount of foreign aid that can be channeled through international organizations like the UN, UNICEF, and the World Bank.[^trump] This move had nothing to do with increasingly constricted civic space but fits within the administration's foreign policy agenda. While we are unable to test this effect systematically with our data, we have some qualitative evidence that donor governments keep anti-NGO restrictions in mind when designing aid policy. For instance, as the Chinese government debated its 2017 Overseas NGO Law, donor governments accounted for the future impacts of the proposed legislation. As a US State Department official pointed out, "the lack of clear communication from the [Chinese] government, coupled with harassment by security authorities, caused some foreign NGOs to suspend or cease operations in the country even before the law took effect" [@usdos:2017, 39]. Moreover, USAID has official policy guidelines encouraging more reliance on domestic, in-country NGOs explicitly to respond to restrictive regulatory proposals. The agency argues that respected NGOs not only assist diplomatic efforts to push for changes that are consistent with international standards, but also help spark local outrage [@USAID2014, 6–7]. This also aligns with what our model predicted for the allocation of contentious aid, where aid becomes more contentious in the wake of additional barriers to entry and funding, and follows the examples of Kyrgyzstan, Kenya, and Cambodia. Thus, it is unlikely that either a decline in overall levels of aid or shifts in aid channeled away from foreign NGOs towards domestic NGOs is a policy undertaken completely independent of restrictions. 


# Implications and conclusion

In this article, we look at the effect of state crackdown on NGOs via legal restrictions on official donors and foreign aid patterns. In particular, we look at the impact of anti-NGO regulation on the amount of aid channeled to countries, the targets of aid, and the purpose of aid based on its contentious nature. Analyzing all official aid-receiving 140 countries from 1981–2012, we find that increasing anti-NGO legal barriers, in particular, barriers to advocacy, decreases the amount of ODA channeled to that country. However, instead of simply scaling back, donors are also being responsive to this crackdown. We find that in the face of increasing barriers to advocacy, donors redirect funds within restrictive countries. Donors decrease funds for politically sensitive causes in favor of tamer issues that are more compatible with the governments of those countries. These findings support recent research that donors, in particular, democracy assistance agencies, tame their programming when confronting dictators [@Bush:2015]. 

Finally, in the face of increasing barriers to funding, donors increase the amount of aid given to domestic NGOs, while decreasing aid given to INGOs working in the restrictive countries. Since previous research has documented that governments often perceive foreign NGOs as external interference in domestic politics, increasing aid to domestic NGOs is likely to assuage these concerns. However, this finding is based on limited data by USAID over only a decade. This finding also reflects USAID's perception that increasing assistance to respected local NGOs can help the regulatory environment from worsening, as these local NGOs can help both diplomatic and lobbying efforts, as well as spark domestic outrage against restrictive legislation. 

Overall, our results challenge existing conceptions of foreign aid in that such assistance often runs on autopilot. We empirically show that donors actively make changes to their aid allocations in response to restrictive anti-NGO legislation, either scaling back their operations or systematically redirecting funds within restrictive countries to different causes or actors.

Our findings have three main implications for both donors and NGOs in developing countries. First, our results have worrying implications for the role of funders as external sources of democratization. Scott and Steele argue that carefully targeted democracy assistance has a greater impact on democratization than general economic aid packages [-@ScottSteele, 63]. However, many recipient governments may want to want avoid such democratization and our results show that these increasing restrictions on NGOs do indeed challenge the efficacy of such democracy assistance and have a chilling support for organizations working in these areas. Further, as @Runde:2017 points out, "Neither remittances nor philanthropy can replace the expertise, scale, or agenda-setting capacity of American foreign policy assistance." Thus, official donor aid is not easily replaceable by other sources. 

Second, a reduction in funding may lead NGOs to turn towards government funding, which can potentially depoliticize their work. Prior literature has shown that organizations self-select into certain sources of funding based on ideology and goals [@BeyersEisingMaloney:2008; @Stroup2012]. Looking at the European Union, Bloodgood and Tremblay-Boire find that increasing government funding to NGOs has a statistically significant and substantial effect on NGO lobbying expenditures [-@BloodgoodTB, 2]. Thus, governments do not necessarily act in a politically benign fashion when they fund NGOs and government funding may indeed dampen political activities by these groups. 

Third, local NGOs may need to invest in resources and manpower to mobilize local resources. Previous scholarly and practitioner work has emphasized that many NGOs have increasingly hired employees and devoted more resources to win foreign grants and contracts [@Bush:2015, 46–49]. Aside from debating the potential adverse effects of such competition and professionalization on the nature of work undertaken by NGOs, it may the case that such practices may not neatly carry over in attempting to procure funding domestically.

While we have outlined some of the broad strategies that donors can undertake in response to restrictive NGO legislation, these are by no means an exhaustive list of strategies. Funders may also undertake a number of other approaches such as increasing availability of emergency funds for recipients facing restrictions or exploring new partnerships with international business actors [@Carothers:2015, 23]—strategies that are not testable in a cross-national approach. Future qualitative work looking at these approaches can both examine a wider range of such strategies and determine their effectiveness. 

Finally, this paper has exclusively looked at how donors respond to changes in regulatory environments for NGOs. However, this environment is just one component of democratic backsliding [@Bermeo2016], and future research should also analyze the broader impact of this phenomenon, including the effects of the strategic manipulation of election or crackdown on media on donor funding decisions.

## Crossed random effects multilevel modeling with time-series cross-sectional data

Following @BellJones:2015 we use crossed random effects for country and year and use a combination of meaned and demeaned versions of each continuous variable to estimate both the within and between effects of each variable. This approach has multiple benefits. The coefficients for the demeaned variables are roughly equivalent to their corresponding coefficients in a fixed effects model, but a fixed effects model assumes that the between effect (captured by the mean variables) is 0, which is not the case. A random effects model specified in this manner is more interpretable, as it clearly separates the within and between effects (within = demeaned, between = mean). Typical time-series-cross-sectional data analysis includes these variables as fixed effects to control out issues of heterogeneity within units. However, @BellJones:2015 forcefully (and convincingly) argue that fixed effects models eliminate too much variance and make it impossible to measure the effects of time-invariant (or slowly-variant) variables. Random effects (or multilevel) models, when properly specified, overcome these issues by decomposing the effects of variables to within- and between-effects (or time-variant and time-invariant effects). 

@tbl:within-between-example demonstrates the intuition behind this approach. Model 1 is a basic OLS model with country fixed effects. Model 2 is a basic OLS model with country random effects, but potentially misspecified, since the between and within effects are conflated. Model 3 is a basic OLS model with country random effects specified with between (mean; $\bar{x}_i$) and within (demeaned; $x_{it} - \bar{x}_i$) coefficients. The demeaned/within coefficients in Model 3 are identical to the fixed effects coefficients in Model 1. If rows had been dropped because of listwise deletion (like, if there were missing values in one of independent variables), the coefficients would be slightly off, since the demeaned values would have been based on group means that included the values that were dropped (e.g. all 2013 rows are dropped because of lags, but the group means included 2013). This is not a problem in these example models, but in our actual models we use multiple imputation to avoid this issue—we need the data to be as complete as possible to get the most accurate random effects.

[^4]: For instance, within the category of "elections," a majority of projects that aim to fund and train election observers, coordinate Get Out The Vote campaigns, or reform the electoral process can be perceived by governments as contentious. However, training leaders about proper conduct of elections, or professionalizing all political parties may not necessarily be contentious, depending on the recipient country.

[^5]: Long-term consolidated democracies are classified by the World Bank as high income; they score below 3 on Freedom House's Scale, receive no aid from USAID, and are not newly independent states [@FinkelPerez-LinanSeligson:2007, 414].

[^6]: The scope of actors covered by these law is diverse, as there are some differences across countries in defining non-governmental organizations (NGOs), nonprofit organizations (NPOs), and civil society organizations (CSOs). For the purposes of this paper, we code legal regulations towards all of these organizations, based on precedent set by previous literature [@christensen2013; @Rutzen:2015].

[^7]: Complete details of how we constructed this dataset, as well as annotated R code for reproducing this dataset, are available at <https://stats.andrewheiss.com/donors-ngo-restrictions/>. The bulk of our new dataset has complete data for every variable in each country-year observation, with only a few variables from V-Dem and the World Bank suffering from missing data: Polity IV, the political corruption index, the civil society regulatory index, population, and GDP. These variables are not missing at random—most of the missing data can be attributable to a lack of consistent reporting. In an effort to avoid the listwise deletion of these important control variables, we employ Bayesian multiple imputation using Honaker, King, and Blackwell's Amelia II [-@HonakerKingBlackwell:2011]. Following @KingHonakerJoseph:2001, we estimate individual regression models across five imputed datasets and then meld and combine the resulting posterior distributions. We varied the number of imputed datasets between 5 and 10 and found only trivial differences in coefficients, as predicted by @KingHonakerJoseph:2001. In the interest of computational efficiency and speed, we only use five imputed datasets in our final analysis.

    Our imputation model predicts missing values using following variables: year, country ID, the civil society regulatory environment (V-Dem), corruption (V-Dem), GDP (log; UN and World Bank), government effectiveness (World Bank), natural disaster occurrence and severity (EM-DAT), Polity IV, population (log; UN and World Bank), trade as a percent of GDP (UN and World Bank), and total ODA (AidData). We also include lags and leads (future values) of the civil society regulatory environment, corruption, GDP, trade as a percent of GDP, Polity IV, and population.

[^domestic-international]: Throughout this paper, we discuss differences between "domestic," "international," and "US-based" NGOs. Domestic NGOs are organizations that are headquartered in the country receiving foreign aid and run by local staff. International NGOs are organizations that are headquartered in a different country from the state receiving aid, while US-based NGOs are international NGOs based in the United States.

[^longer-lags]: We also ran models with two- and five-year lags as robustness checks and find similar results. We include these results in the online appendix.

[^stan]: We use weakly informative prior distributions for each of the coefficient parameters, based on a normal distribution with a mean of zero. We obtain the posterior distribution of each dependent variable with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and simulate values from the joint posterior distribution of the coefficient parameters. We use Stan [@stan] through R [@rstan; @rstanarm; @r-project] to generate 4 MCMC chains with 2,000 iterations in each chain, 1,000 of which are used for warmup. All chains converge; we assess convergence with visual inspection, and diagnostic plots are included in the online appendix. We use the medians of the simulated values from the MCMC samples as coefficient estimates and use the 5% and 95% quantiles as lower and upper limits for 9% credible intervals. Following the suggestion of @GelmanCarlin:2014, we rely on 90% credible intervals for computational stability and for better estimation of Type-S errors. Finally, we estimate models on each of the imputed datasets individually and merge the resulting MCMC chains and posterior distributions. All plots are created with ggplot2 [@ggplot2].
