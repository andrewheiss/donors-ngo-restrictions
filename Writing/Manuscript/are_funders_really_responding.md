# Introduction

In 2013, an Egyptian court imposed jail sentences on 43 NGO employees for failing to comply with the civil society organization (CSO) law, which requires that NGOs must obtain the approval of the Ministry of Social Solidarity before receiving funds from any foreign sources. Similarly, in 2014, the Indian government cancelled the licenses of over 9,000 NGOs, including prominent international groups such as the Ford Foundation and Greenpeace [@India9000]. This crackdown was initiated shortly after the government amended the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), targeting all non-profits receiving money from foreign sources and prohibiting those whose activities were 'political' in nature. 

The use of such restrictive NGO legislations is not unique to the cases of Egypt and India. The last two decades have seen a proliferation such laws, resulting in an increasingly closed space for civil society. According to data from the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, between 2004-10, more than 50 countries enacted measures restricting civil society [@Rutzen2015]. More broadly, between 1990-2013, 79 developing countries introduced severe barriers to entry for NGOs, and 69 countries imposed some form of funding restriction on NGOs - whether in terms of limiting foreign funding or requiring that all money towards NGOs be channeled through government banks [@chaudhry2016]. While recent literature has examined the causes behind state crackdown on NGOs (Carothers and Brechenmacher 2014; Chaudhry 2016, Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash 2016, Heiss 2016), the consequences of this phenomenon have been relatively unexplored [@DupuyPrakash]. Therefore, in this paper we ask - What is the effect of civil society restrictions on foreign aid on donors and aid patterns? Have donors reduced their funding for NGOs working on politically sensitive programming in more restrictive countries? Do trends in global philanthropy reflect donor responses to the legal repression of NGOs in the South?

Understanding the impact of NGO crackdown on donors and funding agencies is vital for two main reasons. First, international donors channel a large amount of aid to developing countries via NGOs. In particular, in states with poor governance records, donors prefer non-governmental mechanisms for transferring aid [@Dietrich2013], as this avoids problems such as corruption and incompetence. In 2012, USAID spent approximately $$4.3$ billion on assistance to civil society around the world, with the World Bank spending approximately $$11$ million on the same in 2009 [@tierney2011]. By imposing restrictions such as tougher barriers to entry for foreign-funded NGOs, prohibiting the operation of foreign-funded NGOs, and the prohibition of political activities by NGOs, restrictive states may deter donors. This crackdown can consequently lead to a decline services offered to citizens in developing countries.

Second, restrictive NGO legislation may also negatively impact the development of robust civic associations, which are often seen as a crucial determinant for healthy democracies [@Putnam1994]. To this end, U.S. and European nations channel a large amount of democracy assistance towards civil society every year. Much of this assistance goes towards lobbying, advocacy, and mobilization around contentious areas such as human rights, elections, and political party development - causes that are unlikely to be funded by the state. According to the International Human Rights Funders Group, in 2010, 703 foundations based in 29 countries made over 12,000 grants totaling $$1.2$ billion to 6,800 organizations worldwide [@DSL2013]. 

Without access to these funds, organizations in the Global South focusing on rights-based issues may cease to exist. This is due to lack of adequate domestic funding, owing to lower levels of per capita GDP and a weak local culture of philanthropy. Even for countries that have substantial wealth, a culture of charitable-giving to NGOs may not exist. For instance, over 90 per cent of human rights NGO activities in Israel are funded from Europe and America [@DPR2015]. Further, even when domestic philanthropists seek to provide money to NGOs, states can often coerce them to withhold their funding by threatening to not approve their business permits or withdrawing their tax exemptions. Finally, there are often differing understandings of human rights wherein people shy away from supporting causes that may be perceived as too political. Thus, a number of NGOs working in contentious issue areas may not be able to operate without financial assistance from abroad. 

In this article, INSERT ARGUMENT AND FINDINGS

Below, we first look at existing literature on the determinants of different varieties of foreign aid, especially to NGOs. While this literature focuses extensively on the politics of donor countries, the politics in recipient countries, especially with regard to their civil society legislations, remains unexplored. We then elaborate on our theory regarding the effects of restrictive NGO legislation on bilateral and multilateral donors, how it impacts the nature of funds disbursed and the kinds of targets that receive these funds. We test our hypotheses through a large-N statistical analysis by looking at changes in aid across X countries from 1981-2013. We conclude by analyzing the implications of our findings, particularly for domestic NGOs in the Global South.


# Foreign Aid and Civil Society

Foreign aid by Western states to developing countries - via bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, and official development assistance - became a booming industry starting in the 1960s. While profound criticism has been leveled against the motivations of aid agencies and the targets of these funds, foreign aid has been steadily increasing - net official development assistance (ODA) increased by 63\% during 2000-10, reaching $$128.5$ billion in 2010 [@LMP2015]. More specifically, over the last two decades, ODA to social sector programs, including civil society promotion has increased relative to foreign aid directed at economic and production sectors. 

@Dietrich2013 argues that donors channel money via NGOs based on their perceptions of aid achieving its intended outcome. In particular, in countries with weak institutions and poor governance, where aid transfers raise issues of misuse and bureaucratic inefficiency, donors specifically seek out NGOs for projects. Previous research has also found that directly sending funds to recipient governments can result in numerous problems - by relaxing leaders' budget constraints, it can delay reforms needed for sustainable economic growth [@Easterly2006]. Direct provision of aid to governments may also promote rent-seeking among local elites [@gibson2005]. Thus, a large amount of Western funds and foreign aid is channeled towards NGOs in developing countries. 

U.S. and Western European democracy promotion agencies, and state and private donors also donate large amounts to NGOs overseas, as the strength of civic associations is often seen as a crucial determinant for healthy democracy [@Putnam2004]. In most developing countries, however, the civil society empowerment strategy has focus entirely on NGOs. This is because NGOs are often viewed as visible, easy-to-reach organizations within civil society. Further, as @ottaway2000 point out, "A central assumption of civil society aid carried out under the auspices of democracy promotion is that advocacy NGOs are a critical segment, perhaps the critical segment, of civil society, at least with regard to democratization. The assumption stems from the belief that the advocacy functions of those groups necessarily engages key democratic processes such as representing interests, challenging the state, and fostering citizens' participation in ways that other kinds of civil society activities do not." Therefore, aid providers from most donors countries and democracy-promoting organizations often end up concentrating on a very narrow set of civil society organizations, namely NGOs.

Despite being the preferred actor of the international community for the above-explained reasons, many states have enacted numerous restrictions against NGOs. Recent research analyzing the causes behind this crackdown has argued that in many cases, foreign funding is seen as providing resources to political opponents [@DPR2016; @carothers2014]. More broadly, Chaudhry (2016) finds that while violent crackdown is useful against NGOs posed ongoing threats, states cannot use violence against all NGOs, as doing so may reduce the state?s legitimacy, violate human rights treaties, and further mobilize the population against the regime. Therefore, in the long term, states prefer restrictive NGO legislation. This is particularly the case when NGOs challenge key economic interests of a state, influence electoral participation, or threaten mobilization. Legal restrictions obfuscate the negative consequences associated with violence and are particularly useful against international NGOs, as violence against them can have more dire consequences for the repressive state.
 
Given the above advantages of using restrictive legislations over violence, such actions have been increasingly employed by states. How do restrictive NGO legislations impact the foreign aid sector, private donors, and democracy promotion community? While the previous research has shown that domestic politics of donor countries are among the main determinants of foreign aid [@MilnerTingley2010], there is comparatively lessser research on how domestic politics of recipient countries affects donor deicisions. Rather, recipient country need is the main factor when considering the other side of equation in aid allocation [@AlesinaDollar2000; @Dreher2009 ; @EasterlyPfutze2008]. 

However, in studies that look at target country characteristics and how that determines the distribution of aid, results regarding door attitudes towards recipient government respect and environment for civil and political rights remain inconclusive. @svensson1999 finds that government respect for political and civic rights has a positive impact upon whether a country receives any aid at all from Canada, Japan, and USA, but not from Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and UK. @Neumayer2003 looking particularly at bilateral aid allocation, finds that respect for civil and political rights plays a statistically significant for almost all aid donors on whether a country is deemed eligible for receipt of aid. Further, low regulatory burden is statistically significant and substantively strong in determining level of aid for good governance. Respect for personal integrity rights is insignificant at best and exerts a positive influence on aid eligibility at worst. However, @poe1992 and @PoeTate1994 find that U.S. aid allocation takes personal integrity rights violations into account. 

Thus, the foreign aid literature remains inconclusive about whether concerns about crackdown on NGOs factor into donor decisions regarding the channeling of foreign aid via non-state actors. However, @DupuyPrakash find that the adoption of restrictive NGO finance laws is associated with a 32\% decline in bilateral aid inflows in subsequent years. On the other hand, multilateral donors and overseas diaspora do not reduce aid in response to such restrictive funding legislations. 

While their analysis lays some necessary groundwork in understand the consequences of state repression of NGOs, their study is limited to a subset of what we analyze in this article, in that they concentrate on new laws that restrict the inflow of foreign monies to domestically operating NGOs. Below, a broader range of restrictive NGO legislations and the varied responses that funders can have to these legislations.


# Theory

While in the 1990s and 2000s, the issue of restrictive NGO legislation had not reached ubiquitous or severe proportions; this is no longer the case. The figures below show that barriers to association, entry, funding, and political activities have been steading increasing at a sustained pace. Further, these numbers are likely to be higher once we take consolidated democracies into account.

INSERT FIGURE HERE

Further, it is becoming evidence that these laws are a result of government desire to restrict rather than simply monitor or audit NGOs [@btb2016]. The figures below show that regulation and restriction are not necessarily mutually exclusive processes. Registration can be made mandatory for NGOs in an effort to streamline state-NGO relations, but governments may also subsequently choose to make these processes burdensome and opaque when it suits their interests. Chaudhry (2016) finds that while many states have made it mandatory for NGOs to register in their territories, very often these requirements are not straightforward. Approval times are lengthy, NGOs may not be allowed appeals in denied registration, and some countries require an unreasonable large number of founders in order to register. Thus, in this paper we do not just look at laws that can be considered as regulation, but we also analyze the impact of laws that can be considered repressive.

(insert registration graph here)

Given the wide range of funders and NGOs that are affected by this global crackdown, we hypothesize that state and private donors can respond to increasingly repressive NGO legislations in two broad ways – they can either scale back their operations, or they can respond to this pushback in a number of other ways, so that indigenous civil society in developing countries is not completely bereft of external assistance. 

## Scaling back

In response to the crackdown on NGOs, we first hypothesize that bilateral and multilateral donors who channel funds via NGOs to developing countries may end up reducing aid. Restrictive NGO legislations may also make the transfer of private foreign aid to NGOs in the Global South difficult. Seeing the problems faced by foreign funded NGOs in developing countries, private donors may instead decide to fund charitable causes at home instead of in other countries. Therefore, we can also expect to see a decline in such kind of transfers.

> **H~1~**: In response to restrictive NGO legislation, bilateral, multilateral, and private donors may reduce their aid to the repressive countries.

## Responding to the global pushback

However, it is unlikely to that states, inter-governmental organizations, and funding agencies will simply scale back their operations when faced with repressive legislations in target countries. In many cases, donors – both state and private – are actively working to find solutions and develop responses to help besieged local NGOs in the Global South. Further, as @Carothers:2015 points out, scaling back is sometimes only visible with the actual departure of funders from the country. For instance, following the 2015 Undesirable Organizations Law, a large number of funding organizations such as the MacArthur Foundation and the National Democratic Institute were asked to leave Russia.

In cases that are not as high-profile, it is more likely that we should observe subtle changes. 

Thus, we expect that donors should change the nature of the causes that they support and the organizations that they work with. This is because of two main reasons. First, with increasing restrictions on the nature of activities undertaken by NGOs, donors may find it difficult to find local NGOs that still work on contentious issue areas such as human rights, elections, and other kinds of rights support. Second, with increasing state rhetoric against civil society groups that threaten the security and sovereignty of the state, donors may find it more politically appropriate to increase the amount of funding for 'tame' causes such as education, health, and social service provision.

> **H~2~**: As restrictive legislations against NGOs are enacted, donors start increasing funds for 'tamer' causes, and decreasing funds for politically sensitive causes

Further, due to constraints on registration, funding, and nature of activities undertaken by local NGOs, donor officials may also be more likely to turn to relevant INGOs in order to perform the same task. Previous research by @Bush2016 has shown that American donor officials actually strongly prefer American NGOs in implementing programming abroad. This is because American NGOs are easier to observe and more likely to share donors' preferences. They also mitigate potential implantation problems.

> **H~3~**: As restrictive legislations against local NGOs increase, states should be more likely to provide aid to INGOs rather than local NGOs

Finally, in response to draconian NGO laws, donors may instead start providing more aid to neighboring countries. For instance, following the Russian Foreign Agent law and the Undesirable Organizations Law in 2015 that led to the closure of thousands of domestic NGOs, as well as international groups such as the MacArthur Foundation, National Democratic Institute, and Human Rights, the Prague Civil Society Center has emerged as a bastion to train and coordinate civil society efforts in Russia. Thus, donors – both state and private – may believe that shifting away from having a direct presence in the country implementing restrictive laws – whether in terms of moving offices to the neighboring countries or holding training in adjacent countries, is more likely to achieve organizational goals.

> **H~4~**: As restrictive legislations against NGOs in a country are enacted, donors should be more likely to provide aid to neighboring countries

## Alternative explanations

Finally, an alternative strand in the foreign aid literature argues that the decision to channel money via NGOs or governments is reflective of the funder's belief in the capacity of either actor to get the job done. In countries with weak state institutions, donor expect a higher probability of aid capture and consequently want to channel more funds via NGOs [@Dietrich2013]. 

> **H~a~**: As countries enact restrictive NGO legislations, states are unlikely to reduce funding to NGOs if the country has weak state institutions (though there are probably other ways to word/test this)


# Method

We analyze donor reactions to state crackdown of NGOs by looking at how foreign aid has changed in response to anti-NGO legislation. We combine variables from several existing datasets and create a cross-sectional time series panel that includes information about aid and NGO legislation in 147 countries from 1981–2013.

## Dependent variables

We measure foreign aid using the OECD's detailed data on aid commitments, which includes all overseas development assistance (ODA) from OECD member countries and multilateral organizations. We use *commitment* amounts rather than actual *disbursement* amounts since disbursement data moves slowly and does not necessarily reflect responses to the political environment—projects take a long time to fulfill and actual inflows of aid in a year can be tied to commitments made years before. Because we are interested in donor reactions to restrictions on NGOs, any reaction would be visible in the decision to commit money to aid, not in the ultimate disbursement of aid, which is most likely already legally obligated and allocated to the country regardless of restrictions on civil society. For our first hypothesis, we calculate the sum of OECD-based ODA committed to each country each year since 1981 (in constant 2011 US dollars), representing nearly $5.5 trillion in total assistance (see figure XXX). 

Aid data from the OECD includes detailed information about the purposes of each grant or project undertaken, which we use to test our second hypothesis. The OECD assigns projects to one of more than 200 different purpose codes in dozens of broader categories such as health, education, and agriculture. We classify contentious aid as any project focused on government and civil society[^1] or conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security,[^2] which include projects focused on elections, human rights, women's equality, freedom of expression, and other issues that could potentially challenge more recalcitrant governments. Nearly $300 million has been allocated for this more aggressive kind of aid since 1980, accounting for more than 10% of all OECD-based foreign aid since 2009 (see figure XXX). 

In our third hypothesis, we posit that more aid will be allocated to international or US-based NGOs than domestic NGOs in response to harsher anti-NGO restrictions. The OECD unfortunately does not uniformly categorize each aid project by delivery channel, which makes it impossible to systematically determine which kinds of organizations receive money. USAID, on the other hand, does offer more granular data about the channels through which aid is delivered. We generate several variables indicating the proportion of American foreign aid channeled through domestic, international, and US-based NGOs. Notably, however, our tests of this hypothesis are based solely on American aid and thus represent only a subset of OECD donor behavior. We consider the total amount of economic aid from 26 different US government agencies in each country annually, as reported in the agency's Green Book, comprising $519 billion since 1981. As is evident in Figure XXX, almost no aid was allocated to NGOs before 2000—in fact, whether by design or by inaccurate reporting, nearly all aid reported by USAID was delivered solely by the United States government until 2000. As such, we also limit our analysis to 2001–2013, adding additional caveats to the interpretation of this hypothesis.

Finally, in our fourth hypothesis, we propose that donors shift aid to neighboring countries in response to anti-NGO legislation. We calculate the total ODA in each country's neighbors, defined as all states within 900 km of the closest border, which provides a more accurate sense of a country's neighbors than simply looking at shared contiguous borders [@Gleditsch:2002].

## Explanatory Variables

Our main independent variables of interest are restrictive NGO legislations and changes in the legal framework for civil society organizations. First, we use a number of dichotomous variables on barriers to entry, funding, and advocacy across 148 countries from 1981-2013, based on data from Chaudhry (2016) and @christensen2013. In addition to panel data on the presence or absence of specific NGO regulations, we create several indices for each of the categories of regulation - association, entry, funding, and advocacy, along with the variable Total Barriers which is the sum of all four indices.

An alternative way of measuring civil society restrictions is to look at the overal civil society regulatory environment rather than specific laws, since de jure restrictions do not always map clearly into de facto restrictions (especially in dictatorships where the implementation of laws is more discretionary). Andrew Heiss (2016)  developed a new civil society regulatory environment index (CSRE), which combines two civil society indexes from the Varieties of Democracy project (V-Dem): (1) civil society repression and (2) civil society entry and exit regulations. The CSRE ranges from roughly −6 to 6 (though typically only from −4 to 4), and shows more variation over time since it ostensibly captures changes in the implementation of the regulatory environment rather than the presence or absence of legislation. While the main focus of this paper is donor response to new legislation, we also look at donor response to changes in the overall CSRE as a robustness check.

## Controls

As the previous literature on aid policy finds, various factors shape donor decisions about allocation of aid. We include them as controls to provide a fully specified model. First, we control for Democracy based on the understanding that donors see it is as a factor that limits the ability of recipient governments and democratic institutions to utilize aid flows. We measure this on a 0-10 scale using Polity IV data [@PolityIV]. We also control for wealth based on the understanding that donors are likely to give less aid to richer countries. We measure this in three ways - first, GDP per capita using data from World Development Indicators (WDI); second, trade as a percentage of GDP from WDI; and third, aid dependence from AidData and WDI. 

We also control for Natural Disaster Death and Internal Conflict based on the understanding that a greater number of deaths and grievances may prompt donors to provide aid to non-state actors that are specialized in reconstruction efforts. We use the EM-DAT [@EMDAT] for the former and a binary indicator variable to see if there was a conflict in the current year or past 5 years (?) from UCDP-PRIO [@UCDPPRIO]. 

We also test for alternative hypotheses and control for government capacity based on the understanding that donors are more likely to give more aid to NGOs in countries with weak institutions. We measure this using Corruption from the Varieties of Democracy (V-DEM) dataset [@VDEM] and the World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI). Finally, we control for Former Colony, as donor countries are known to favor former colonies.

# Conclusion

In this article, we analyzed the impact of increasingly restrictive NGO legislation on state and private donors. We found LALALA

While we have outlined some of the broad strategies that donors have undertaken in response to restrictive NGO legislation, these are by no means, an exhaustive list of strategies. Funders may also undertake a number of other approaches such as increasing availability of emergency funds for grantees in troubles and exploring new partnerships with international business actors [@Carothers:2015] - strategies that are not testable in a cross-national approach. However, future qualitative work looking at these approaches can both examine a wider range of such strategies, as well as adjudicate between their effectiveness. 

Our findings have strong implications not just for donors, but for the operation of domestic NGOs across the Global South and the sustainability of the civil society sector in these regions as well. In order to overcome problems associated with the lack of external funding, local NGOs may now need to locate their headquarters outside their repressive states. Many organizations have also started mobilizing local resources – besides decreasing reliance on international donors, access to a sustainable stream of local resources may also allow organizations to be more responsive to community needs. Indeed, the muted response from the international community may decrease local NGO trust in the donor community. For instance, after Ethiopia's 2009 Charities and Societies Proclamation which shut down nearly all of the country's human rights sector [@DPR2015], the international response has been cautious. Official statements from the US and the European Union have been heavily critized as "timid" and "unpricipled" [@HRW2009]. 



However, if restrictive regulatory environments make it too hard for Northern groups and states to fund organizations in the Global South, will local philanthropy grow to fill the gap?
