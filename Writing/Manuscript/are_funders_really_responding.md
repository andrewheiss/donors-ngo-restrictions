   The past two decades have seen a proliferation of laws targeted against non-governmental organizations (NGOs), resulting in increasingly restricted space for these organizations to provide services or engage in advocacy. How do Western donors respond to this legal crackdown on NGOs? We use original data on civil society restrictions across all official aid recipients from 1981–2013 to assess the impact of these restrictions on total flows of foreign aid, how aid is distributed, and which issues are funded. We find that additional anti-NGO legal barriers—in particular, barriers to advocacy—decrease the amount of foreign channeled to restrictive countries. Additionally, we find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries and decrease funding for politically sensitive causes in favor of tamer issues that are more compatible with the governments of those countries. Finally, we find that donors—USAID in particular—channel more aid to domestic rather than foreign NGOs in order to assuage target country concerns about external interference in domestic politics. The implications of these findings are worrisome for both Western donors, which channel a large amount of foreign aid through NGOs, and for NGOs, many of which are unable to sustain themselves without financial support from abroad.

In 2013, an Egyptian court imposed jail sentences on 43 non-governmental organization (NGO) employees for failing to comply with the country's civil society organization (CSO) law, which required all NGOs to obtain approval from the Ministry of Social Solidarity before receiving funds from any foreign sources [@egypt-ngos-afp:2012]. Similarly, in 2014, the Indian government cancelled the licenses of over 9,000 NGOs, including prominent international NGOs (INGOs) such as the Ford Foundation and Greenpeace, with the aim of targeting all nonprofits receiving money from foreign sources and prohibiting those whose activities were "political" in nature. [@India9000].  The use of restrictive anti-NGO laws is not unique to the cases of Egypt and India. The last two decades have seen a proliferation of such laws TODO: GIVE NUMBERS HERE. While recent literature has examined the causes behind state crackdown on NGOs [@carothers2014; @DPR2016; @Chaudhry:2016; @Heiss:2016a], the consequences of this phenomenon have been relatively unexplored [@DupuyPrakash]. What is the effect of state crackdown on NGOs via these legal restrictions on donors and foreign aid patterns? 

Be examining all 148 countries that received some form of foreign aid from 1981–2013, we find that donors systematically respond to changes in the regulatory environment for NGOs. In particular, we look at the impact of anti-NGO regulation on (1) the amount of aid channeled to countries, (2) the targets of aid, and (3) the purpose of aid based on its contentious nature TODO fix this. Overall, we find that donors respond to domestic crackdowns on NGOs by scaling back their operations and reducing total aid commitments. More specifically, new anti-NGO legal barriers—and barriers to advocacy, in particular—decrease the amount of official development assistance (ODA) channeled to countries. However,  instead of a complete withdrawal and scaling back, donors also responding in two main ways. First, we we find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries, decreasing funds for politically sensitive causes in favor of tamer issues that are more compatible with the governments of those countries. Second, in order to assuage concerns about foreign NGOs acting as a vehicle for external interference in domestic politics, donors—in particular the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)—channels more aid through domestic NGOs and significantly decreases aid disbursed through foreign NGOs. Our results challenge existing conceptions of foreign aid, wherein such assistance is often considered to be on autopilot for decades, without considering the political contexts of their target countries [@Brainard2007; @Carothers2015, 64].  

Understanding the impact of NGO crackdown on donors and funding agencies is vital for three reasons. First, international donors channel a large amount of aid to developing countries via NGOs. In states with poor governance records, donors prefer non-governmental mechanisms for transferring aid [@Dietrich2013], as this avoids problems such as corruption and incompetence, and prevents rent-seeking among local elites [@gibson2005]. In 2012, USAID spent approximately \$4.3 billion on assistance to civil society around the world, while the World Bank spent approximately \$11 million on the same in 2009 [@tierney2011]. U.S. and Western European democracy promotion agencies and private donors also allocate large amounts of aid to NGOs overseas [@Smith:2000]. By imposing restrictions such as tougher barriers to entry for foreign-funded NGOs, prohibiting the operation of foreign-funded NGOs, and the prohibition of political activities by NGOs, restrictive states may deter donors. This crackdown can consequently lead to a decline in services offered to citizens in developing countries.

Second, both foreign aid and democracy aid is often considered unresponsive to developments on the ground [@Brainard2007; @Carothers2015, 64]. In particular, Carothers suggests that democracy aid allocation is often on "autopilot", which he describes as, "carrying out many types of programs in one setting with little careful thought about which among them offer the most fruitful avenues for change" [-@Carothers2015, 25]. However, our results show that this is not the case—donors systematically respond to changes in the regulatory environment of the organizations implementing their goals. Thus, we document and explain donor responsiveness, particularly how donors can strategically shift funds both within and across recipient countries.

Third, our results have worrying implications for the prospects of democratization, especially in developing countries. Robust civic associations are often seen as a crucial component for healthy democracies [@Putnam1994]. To this end, many nations channel a large amount of democracy assistance towards civil society every year and democracy assistance has become a pillar of U.S. foreign policy [@Smith:2000]. However, recent research has shown that recipient countries often see such assistance as Western intervention in domestic politics and consequently enact anti-NGO legislations. Our paper shows that such legislations are actually having its intended impact on the ability of these organizations to procure funds and carry out their operations, which can eventually force a number of NGOs to shut down. This, in turn, adversely affects the agendas of both the foreign aid and democracy promotion community.  

Below, we first examine the existing literature on foreign aid and NGOs. While this literature focuses extensively on the politics of donor countries, the politics of recipient countries—especially with regard to their laws governing civil society—remains unexplored. We then elaborate on our theory regarding the effects of restrictive NGO legislation on bilateral and multilateral donors, the nature of activities funded, and the kinds of targets that receive these funds. We test our hypotheses through a large-*N* statistical analysis by looking at changes in aid across 148 countries from 1981–2013. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings.


# Foreign aid, civil society, and restrictions on NGOs

Foreign aid by Western states to developing countries via bilateral and multilateral official development assistance (ODA) became a booming industry starting in the 1960s. Previous work has documented the importance of material resources in the form of grants, contracts, subsidies from states, and foundations, in explaining the growth and proliferation of NGOs all across the world [@Reimann2006, 48]. Foreign aid has thus been steadily increasing—net ODA increased by 63% during 2000–10, reaching \$128.5 billion by 2010 [@LMP2015, 295]. Moreover, in many developing countries, donors prefer to channel funds via non-governmental mechanisms based on their perceptions of aid achieving its intended outcome [@Dietrich2013]. This is because directly transferring aid to recipient governments is considered to create perverse incentives for developing country leaders by relaxing their budget constraints and promoting rent-seeking among local elites [@Easterly2006; @gibson2005].

While NGOs may be the preferred actor of the international community, states do not necessarily view the proliferation and spread of NGOs as positive development. Many states, in fact, have enacted legal restrictions against NGOs, making it increasingly difficult for NGOs to carry out their operations and survive in the restrictive countries. According to data from the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, between 2004–10, more than 50 countries enacted measures restricting civil society [@Rutzen:2015, 3]. More broadly, between 1990–2013, 79 developing countries introduced severe barriers to entry for NGOs, and 69 countries imposed some form of funding restriction on NGOs—whether in terms of limiting foreign funding or requiring that all money towards NGOs be channeled through government banks [@Chaudhry:2016].

TODO: CIVICUS MAP HERE 

Recent research analyzing the causes behind this crackdown has argued that, in many cases, foreign funding to these groups is seen as providing resources to political opponents and allows foreign governnments to interfere in their domestic affairs [@DPR2016; @carothers2014; @mendelson2015]. More broadly, @Chaudhry:2016 finds that while violent crackdown is useful against NGOs posing immediate threats, states cannot use violence against all NGOs, as doing so may reduce the state's legitimacy, violate human rights treaties, and further mobilize the population against the regime. Therefore, in the long-term, states prefer restrictive NGO legislation since they overcome the negative consequences associated with violence.

It is important to note that not all NGO-related legislation is necessarily aimed at restricting NGOs. Laws and regulations establish standards for appropriate individual or organizational behavior and set penalties for violations [@North1990]. Governments frequently use regulations to routinize the behavior of NGOs—regulations produce convergent practices and reduce uncertainty in the future [@BloodgoodTB, 145] and prevent malfeasance that threatens to undermine confidence in the entire NGO community [@GibelmanGelman; @ONeill2009]. Standard reglations requiring mandatory registration for NGOs, filing reports of their annual activities and funding sources help prevent the spread of "briefcase NGOs," or organizations that exist only on paper and provide little to no service. Standard regulations can also increase organizational rights and improve access to the policy-making process [@btb2016; @Teets2014]. Thus, regulatory barriers are not inherently negative and can have a positive impact. 

In this article, however, we focus primarily on the impact of restrictive regulations or anti-NGO laws. Unlike regulations aimed at standardizing state–NGO relations, these laws are intended to have a negative impact on the NGO community by creating deliberate barriers to their entry, funding, and advocacy. Barriers to entry include laws that make it more difficult for domestic and international NGOs to set up operations in a country. For instance, in many states, mandatory registration requirements are rarely straightforward: approval times are lengthy, there are vague critera for registration, NGOs may not be allowed appeals in denied registration, and some countries require an unreasonably large number of founders or funds in order to register [@Chaudhry:2016; @Heiss:2017]. 

Barriers to funding impose restrictions on NGOs based on the origin of their funds, how those funds are channeled, and which issues these funds can be used towards. Restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs (completely or partially), or for NGOs working in a particular sector, have become the most pervasive form of legislative crackdown against these groups TODO: simplify this sentence. These funding restrictions are worrisome because citizens in many countries are often too poor to support local NGOs, may lack a culture of philanthropic giving, or may prefer to channel funds to groups working in non-contentious areas such as health and education [@DPR2015; @RPC:2016; @Brechenmacher:2017]. Even when domestic donors wish to donate to NGOs working in contentious areas, they are often deterred by dismal tax incentives, threats to take away business permits, or have a general fear of retribution [@HudsonInstitute:2015; @Baoumi:2016]. 

Finally, barriers to advocacy enable countries to bar NGOs from working on political issues, where "political" is intentionally vaguely defined in order to provide an easy cover for governments to crack down on NGOs they perceive as politically threatening. TODO: Something from my stuff on authoritarianism and regime stability and NGOs


# The impact of restrictive NGO legislation

How does restrictive NGO legislation impact the foreign aid sector and democracy promotion community? In particular, how does it impact donor behavior in regards to the amount and targets of aid? Previous research analyzing determinants of foreign aid has looked at both domestic politics of donor countries[@MilnerTingley2010], as well as the needs of recipient countries [@AlesinaDollar2010; @Dreher2009; @EasterlyPfutze2008]. In studies that look at the impact of recepient country characteristics on the distribution of aid, the effect of recipient governments' respect civil and political rights on the amount of aid that a country receives remain inconclusive [@svensson1999]. @Neumayer:2003 finds that low regulatory burden is statistically significant and substantively strong in determining level of aid for good governance. Respect for personal integrity rights is also insignificant at best and exerts a positive influence on aid eligibility at worst [@poe1992; @PoeTate1994]. Thus, the foreign aid literature remains inconclusive about whether concerns about crackdown on NGOs factor into donor decisions regarding the channeling of foreign aid via non-state actors. 

@DupuyPrakash, looking at the effects of the adoption of restrictive NGO finance laws, find that it is associated with a 32% decline in bilateral aid inflows in subsequent years. On the other hand, multilateral donors and overseas diaspora do not reduce aid in response to such restrictive funding laws. While @DupuyPrakash lay the necessary groundwork for understanding the consequences of state crackdown on NGOs, their study is limited to a subset of what we analyze in this article—they concentrate on new laws that restrict the inflow of foreign funds to domestically operating NGOs. In contrast, we analyze a wide variety of laws beyond barriers to funding, including barriers to association, entry, and advocacy. Further, we not only analyze how donors respond with changes in overall levels of aid to a country, but also how donors systematically shift aid allocations to different sectors, issues and targets within a country depending on the nature of the restrictions being implemented against NGOs. 

Given the wide range of donors and NGOs affected by this global crackdown, we argue that donors (both within the foreign aid and democracy promotion community) can respond to increasingly repressive NGO legislation in two broad ways—they can either scale back their operations, or they can systematically redirect funds within restrictive countries to different causes and actors (and in some cases, both).  

## Scaling back

In response to the crackdown on NGOs, we first hypothesize that bilateral and multilateral donors who channel funds via NGOs to developing countries may reduce aid. This is because of three main reasons. First, critics may believe that aid will be effective only if delivered through non-governmental mechanisms. Without this option, donors may have to channel funds directly to recipient governments and in doing so, may end up reducing their total aid. 

Second, restrictive NGO legislation can also be perceived as implying a declining respect for civil and political rights in the target state. Consequently, donors may choose to channel democracy assistance towards civil society groups in countries that are in a better position to utilize these funds. Therefore, we can expect to see a decline in bilateral transfers and official development assistance to countries that pass restrictive NGO legislation. 

Finally, donors may reduce their funding to countries enacting restrictive NGO legislation because of the disappearance or reduction of appropriate NGO partners in that country. Dupuy and Prakash [-@DupuyPrakash, 420], examining the regulatory offensive against NGOs in Ethiopia, find that this legislation against foreign-funded NGOs has shut down a majority of the NGOs in the human rights sector in the country. Thus, with fewer NGOs, and in many cases, with the disappearance of trusted NGO partners, donors may hesitate to channel money to remaining NGOs, especially those with whom they have not previously partnered. 

> **H~1~**: If countries adopt restrictive NGO legislation, then bilateral and multilateral donors reduce their aid to the repressive countries.

## Responding to the crackdown

However, it is unlikely that donors always simply scale back their operations when faced with repressive legislation in target countries. In many cases, donors—both state and private—actively work to find solutions and develop responses to help besieged local NGOs in the Global South. Further, as Carothers [-@Carothers:2015, 15] points out, scaling back is sometimes only visible with the actual departure of funders from the country. For instance, following the 2015 Undesirable Organizations Law, a large number of funding organizations such as the MacArthur Foundation and the National Democratic Institute were asked to leave Russia. In cases that do not have as high a profile, it is more likely that we should observe subtle changes. We emphasize two such changes. 

First, we expect that donors should change the nature of the causes that they support and the organizations that they work with. This is because of two main reasons. First, with increasing restrictions on the nature of activities undertaken by NGOs, donors may find it difficult to identify local NGOs that still work on contentious issue areas such as human rights, elections, political parties, youth groups, anti-corruption organizations and institutions, increasing democratic participation, and advocacy[^Regimecompatible]. Describing the nature of state-civil society relationships in China, @Teets2014 argues that the Chinese government not just allows, but encourages NGOs working in areas such as public health, education reform, and disaster relief. In doing so, better governance, rather than democratization, is the desired goal. Therefore, with increasing state rhetoric against civil society groups that threaten the security and sovereignty of the state, donors may find it more politically appropriate to increase the amount of funding for "tame" causes such as education, health, and social service provision [@Bush:2015].

> **H~2~**: If countries adopt restrictive NGO legislation, then donors increase funds for "tamer" causes and decrease funds for politically sensitive causes

Second, due to constraints on entry and funding for INGOs, donors may instead turn to domestic NGOs in the hope that repressive states view these domestic groups as less suspicious compared to INGOs. Previous research by @Bush2016 has shown that American donor officials actually strongly prefer American NGOs in implementing programming abroad. This is because American NGOs are easier to observe, are more likely to share donors' preferences, and may also mitigate potential implementation problems, making it easier for donors to monitor progress and receive reports. 

However, we argue there are two reasons for why donors may prefer domestic NGOs to international or US-based NGOs in restrictive regulatory environments. First, donors may think that these laws are being passed based on government perception of foreign influence in domestic politics [@DupuyPrakash]. In order to assuage this perception, USAID claims see more benefit in funding domestic NGOs rather than foreign NGOs. Second, in anticipation of increasing restrictions to civil society, USAID claims to increase technical assistance to local civil society organizations (CSOs) in order to respond to restrictive regulatory proposals. They posit that respected CSOs not only assist diplomatic efforts to push for changes that are consistent with international standards, but also help spark local outrage [@USAID2014, 6–7]. For instance, in Cambodia in 2011, in order to counter the passage of a restrictive NGO law, USAID provided technical assistance to local NGOs who were able to coordinate a strong lobbying effort against the passage of the bill. 

> **H~3~**: If countries adopt restrictive NGO legislation against local NGOs, then donors are more likely to increase aid to domestic NGOs and decrease aid to INGOs. 



# Data and methods

We analyze donor reactions to state crackdown of NGOs by looking at how foreign aid has changed in response to anti-NGO legislation. We combine variables from several existing datasets and create a cross-sectional time series panel that includes information about aid and NGO legislation in 148 countries from 1981–2013.[^1] Summary statistics for all the variables we use in our models are provided in @tbl:var-summary.

\small

\normalsize

## Dependent variables

We measure foreign aid using the OECD's detailed data on aid commitments, which includes all overseas development assistance (ODA) from OECD member countries and multilateral organizations. Following guidance from the OECD,[^oecd] we use *commitment* amounts rather than actual *disbursement* amounts since disbursement data moves slowly and does not necessarily reflect responses to the political environment—projects take a long time to fulfill and actual inflows of aid in a year can be tied to commitments made years before. Because we are interested in donor reactions to restrictions on NGOs, any reaction would be visible in the decision to commit money to aid, not in the ultimate disbursement of aid, which is already legally obligated and allocated to the country regardless of changes in civil society restrictions. For our first hypothesis, we calculate the sum of OECD-based ODA committed to each country each year since 1981 (in constant 2011 US dollars), representing nearly $5.5 trillion in total assistance (see the top left panel of @fig:dvs). 

![**Top left (H~1~)**: total overseas development assistance (ODA) committed to all countries; **top right (H~2~)**: proportion of OECD ODA committed to contentious programs; **bottom left**: total US foreign aid committed to all countries; **bottom right (H~3~)**: proportion of US foreign aid channeled through different types of NGOs](../../Output/fig-dvs){#fig:dvs}

Aid data from the OECD includes detailed information about the purposes of each grant or project undertaken, which we use to test our second hypothesis. The OECD assigns projects to one of more than 200 different purpose codes in dozens of broader categories such as health, education, and agriculture. We classify contentious aid as any project focused on government and civil society[^2] or conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security[^3]. While the former includes projects on anti-corruption organizations and institutions, democratic participation and civil society, elections, media, human rights, legal and judicial reform, legislature and political parties, the latter includes security sector reform, civilian peacebuilding, and child soldiers. It is important to note that the latter aid on peace and security does not include military aid. While we recognize that not all projects within categories are outrightly contentious, we have classified them as such based on the assumption that states perceive a majority of programs within these categories as contentious[^4]. These categories also overlap with Bush's definition of categories of democracy assistance that classifies as "Not regime compatible" [@Bush:2015, 57]. Nearly $300 million has been allocated for this more aggressive kind of aid since 1980, accounting for more than 10% of all OECD-based foreign aid since 2009 (see the top right panel of @fig:dvs). 

In our third hypothesis, we posit that more aid will be allocated to domestic NGOs than international or US-based NGOs in response to harsher anti-NGO restrictions. The OECD unfortunately does not uniformly categorize each aid project by delivery channel, which makes it impossible to systematically determine which kinds of organizations receive money. USAID, on the other hand, offers more granular data about the channels through which aid is delivered. We generate several variables indicating the proportion of American foreign aid channeled through domestic, international, and US-based NGOs. Notably, however, our tests of this hypothesis are based solely on American aid and thus represent only a subset of OECD donor behavior. We consider the total amount of economic aid from 26 different US government agencies in each country annually, as reported in the agency's Green Book, comprising $519 billion since 1981, and $248 billion since 2000 (see the bottom left panel of @fig:dvs). As is evident in the bottom right panel of @fig:dvs, almost no aid was allocated to NGOs before 2000—due to changes in reporting standards, nearly all aid reported by USAID was delivered solely by the United States government until 2000. As such, we also limit our analysis to 2001–2013, adding additional caveats to the interpretation of this hypothesis.

To capture the lagged effect of each explanatory variable on amount of aid in a given year, we shift our different measures of foreign aid ahead by one year (instead of lagging all the explanatory variables individually). As a robustness check we also include models with aid leaded by two years and five years and find similar results. For the sake of modeling, we transform our measures of aid differently for each hypothesis: when looking at total aid amounts, we take the natural log of aid; when looking at proportions of aid, we use a logit transformation and add or subtract 0.001 from values that are exactly 0 or 1. @eq:all-models-dvs lists the simplified functional forms for each hypothesis.

## Explanatory variables

We are primarily interested in donor reactions to restrictive NGO legislation, which we measure in a few different ways. First, we use data from @chaudhry2016 and @christensen2013, who track the presence or absence of standard and restrictive NGO legislation across all developing democracies, hybrid, and authoritarian states. We do not include consolidated democracies as these countries are the providers of aid and not the recipients of aid, and this paper seeks to analyze how restrictive anti-NGO legislation in recepient countries impacts donors[^5]. These laws are categorized by purpose and encompass barriers to association, entry, funding, and advocacy[^6]. We create summative indexes for the laws in each of these categories (see @tbl:ngo-barriers-index), as well as binary variables that indicate if a new law in a category was passed in a given year. The NGO legislation data indicates only the year of initial appearance of a legal barrier, so we carry the inverse of the first known value backwards (e.g. because Albania did not require NGO registration until 2001, it is coded as 0 until that year). As can be seen in the left panel of @fig:barriers, on average countries have eliminated barriers to association through constitutional and legal reforms, but have steadily increased the number of barriers to entry, funding, and advocacy. In particular, the average number of barriers to funding has increased more rapidly than other barriers since 2000.

\normalsize

An alternative method for measuring civil society restrictions is to look at the overall civil society regulatory environment instead of specific laws, since *de jure* legislation does not always reflect the *de facto* restrictions. Actual laws can lie dormant until needed for repression. For instance, Russia passed the Undesirable Organizations law of 2015 with the purpose of targeting and eliminating specific foreign-connected NGOs it deemed dangerous. One of the law's sponsors, Aleksandr Tarnavsky, described the law as a preventative measure that would not affect the majority of NGOs working in Russia. Rather, the law would be a "weapon hanging on the wall… that never fires" and stand as a warning to potentially uncooperative NGOs [@Kozenko:2015]. Simply counting laws therefore misses the effect of their de facto implementation—laws could be benignly routine, dangerously dormant, or outrightly restrictive. 

To address this disconnect, @Heiss:2016a developed a new civil society regulatory environment index (CSRE), which combines two civil society indexes from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project [@VDEM]: (1) civil society repression and (2) civil society entry and exit regulations. The CSRE index ranges from roughly −6 to 6 (though typically only from −4 to 4), and shows more variation over time since it ostensibly captures changes in the implementation of the regulatory environment rather than the presence or absence of legislation. The right panel of @fig:barriers shows how the average global CSRE index has changed over time, and the trends tend to match changes in legislation—the CSRE reflects the decline in barriers to association in the 1990s. At the same time, since the CSRE captures the effects of the implementation of laws, it shows a marked drop in 2012 and 2013, which is not reflected in the overall count of NGO legislation, possibly because of discretionary enforcement. While the main focus of this paper is donor response to new legislation, we also look at donor response to changes in the overall CSRE as a robustness check.

## Controls

As explained previously, an active and contentious literature has long debated what determines how much foreign aid donors allocate to countries. Research has found that donors give more to smaller, poorer countries that share former colonial or present diplomatic ties [@Neumayer:2003; @AndersenHansenMarkussen:2006; @MilnerTingley2010], or that suffer from internal conflict, natural disasters, and other unexpected shocks [@Raddatz:2007; @BezerraBraithwaite:2016]. Other factors play less of a role, such as a country's military spending, respect for personal integrity rights, regime type, domestic instability, political ideology, or quality of governance [@Neumayer:2003a; @Neumayer:2003b]. Therefore, we control for four general themes found in previous research: democracy, wealth, government capacity, and unexpected shocks. 

We control for the level of *democracy* in a country based on the understanding that donors consider the ability of recipient governments and democratic institutions to utilize aid flows. We measure democratization using data from Polity IV [@PolityIV], rescaled from 0–10, with 10 being most democratic. We also include a binary indicator marking years after 1989 to account for differences in post-Cold War foreign aid. Since we believe that a country's wealth and aid dependence influences donation decisions, we measure a country's *wealth* in two ways, based on GDP and trade measures from the UN and World Bank: (1) GDP per capita, measured in constant 2011 US dollars, and (2) the amount of trade—both imports and exports—as a percent of GDP. 

An alternative strand in the foreign aid literature argues that the decision to channel money via NGOs or governments is reflective of the funder's belief in the capacity of either actor to get the job done. In countries with weak or corrupt state institutions, donors expect a higher probability of aid capture and consequently want to channel more funds via NGOs [@Dietrich2013]. Given the influence of *government capacity* in donor decision making, we include the political corruption index from V-Dem [@McMannPemsteinSeim:2016], which accounts for public sector, executive, legislative, and judicial corruption, and ranges from 0–10, with 10 being most corrupt. Finally, we include two measures of *unexpected shocks*, based on the idea that more deaths and damages from natural disasters or internal armed conflict may prompt donors to provide aid for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. We measure the occurrence of natural disasters with a binary indicator from the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT) [@EMDAT], marking whether or not a disaster occurred in a given year, and we use data from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict dataset [@gleditsch2002] to indicate the presence of an internal conflict in the past five years.

Foreign aid exhibits significant serial correlation, since the current year's level of aid is dependent on previous commitments. To account for this, we include the value of the dependent variable (i.e. aid, proportion of contentious aid, etc.) in the previous year as a final control.

## Missing values

The bulk of our new dataset has complete data for every variable in each country-year observation, with only a few variables from V-Dem and the World Bank suffering from missing data: Polity IV, the political corruption index, the civil society regulatory index, population, and GDP. These variables are not missing at random—most of the missing data can be attributable to a lack of consistent reporting. In an effort to avoid the listwise deletion of these important control variables, we employ Bayesian multiple imputation using Honaker, King, and Blackwell's [-@HonakerKingBlackwell:2011] *Amelia II*. Following @KingHonakerJoseph:2001, we estimate individual regression models across five imputed datasets and then meld and combine the resulting posterior distributions.[^7]

## Modeling strategy

We account for country and year effects to distinguish between natural time-variant and country-specific changes in donor behavior to increased NGO restrictions. Typical time-series-cross-sectional data analysis includes these variables as fixed effects to control out issues of heterogeneity within units. However, @BellJones:2015 forcefully (and convincingly) argue that fixed effects models eliminate too much variance and make it impossible to measure the effects of time-invariant (or slowly-variant) variables. Random effects (or multilevel) models, when properly specified, overcome these issues by decomposing the effects of variables to within- and between-effects (or time-variant and time-invariant effects). Following Bell and Jones, we use crossed random effects multilevel models for both country and year and decompose each continuous variable into meaned and demeaned forms by calculating the average value of that variable within a country and subtracting that mean from each individual observation. More formally, as seen in @eq:re-within-between, the $\beta_1$ coefficient represents the value for the demeaned variable ($x_{it} - \bar{x}_i$) and corresponds to the time-variant effect of that variable *within* an individual country (i.e. how $x$ influences $y$ over time). $\beta_2$, on the other hand, represents the value for the mean of the variable ($\bar{x}_i$) and corresponds to the time-*in*variant effect of that variable *between* all countries (i.e. how the general level of $x$ is associated with $y$ across all countries). 

$$ y_{i, t + 1} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (x_{it} - \bar{x}_i) + \beta_2 \bar{x}_i + \ldots $$ {#eq:re-within-between}

While this model specification is at first a little unwieldy, it has multiple benefits. The coefficients for demeaned (or *within*) variables in this kind of random effects model are roughly equivalent to their corresponding coefficients in a fixed effects model, and are thus generally the coefficients of interest. These coefficients can be interpreted like standard regression coefficients: on average, accounting for differences over time, a unit change in $x_t$ in a given country corresponds to a $\beta_1$ change in $y_{t+1}$. The *between* effects, on the other hand, reflect the cross-sectional variance and do not indicate changes in variable values. Instead, these coefficients show how the average level of each explanatory variable is related to the dependent variable: on average, countries with higher (or lower) $x$ tend to have higher (or lower) $y$. Fixed effects models assume that these between coefficients are zero, which leads to Bell and Jones's primary criticism of fixed effects regression—too much between-unit variance is swallowed up by fixed effects and helpful information is lost. A random effects model specified in this manner clearly separates the within from the between effects.

Finally, we test our hypotheses using a series of Bayesian regression models, rather than frequentist null hypothesis significance tests (NHST). Bayesian methods yield more meaningful inferences [@Kruschke:2015; @Korner-NievergeltRothFelten:2015; @GelmanCarlinStern:2013]: whereas NHST analysis determines the *probability of the data* given a *null hypothesis* (i.e. $P(\text{data} | H_0)$), Bayesian analysis determines the *probability of a hypothesis* given *the data* (i.e. $P(H | \text{data})$). Bayesian models return full posterior probability distributions for each parameter instead of simple point estimates, meaning that the probability of a given hypothesis can be calculated directly and corresponds to the proportion of the posterior distribution that falls on either side of zero [@Galantucci:2014; @Gill:2014]. For each model variable, we report the posterior median, the proportion of the distribution that is greater than zero (or the probability), and the 95% credible interval, or the range of the posterior distribution that has a 95% chance of containing the true value of the estimated coefficient.[^stan] 


# Results and analysis

We present the estimates of our different models in coefficient plots below. Since there are many control variables, and most are doubled up with *within* and *between* effects, we only include variables related to the NGO regulatory environment in each plot. The full results of all models are included in the appendix, and @tbl:findings-summary summarizes the main findings for each hypothesis.

## Changes in overall aid

We first look at how anti-NGO legal barriers affect ODA in the following year (see @fig:coefs-h1). The total number of legal barriers has a negative effect on foreign aid—adding a new barrier or law beyond a country's average level of laws is associated with a 9% reduction in aid in the next year (P(\> 0) = 0.06). The overall number of barriers matters more than simply increasing legal restrictions, since the binary indicator for adding a new legal barrier has no substantial influence on aid. When we disaggregate the effect of different types of restrictions, we find that donors respond primarily to advocacy barriers. Increasing limitations on advocacy beyond a country's average level is associated with a 49% drop in aid the following year, on average (P(\> 0) = 0.04). Barriers to entry and barriers to funding do not influence aid, however. This relationship holds when looking at the binary addition of laws—aid decreases by 99% in the year following the passage of a new barrier to advocacy (P(\> 0) = 0.06), but does not change when adding other legal restrictions. Finally, the overall civil society regulatory environment does not have any effect on foreign aid in the following year. Almost none of the between effects are different from zero, with one exception: countries with more legal barriers to entry tend to have higher levels of aid (P(\> 0) = 1).

![Determinants of OECD ODA in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 95% credible interval.](../../Output/fig-coefs-h1-bayes){#fig:coefs-h1}

The substantive impact of these coefficients can be seen in @fig:predicted-h1, which shows the predicted level of foreign aid across 500 draws from the posterior distribution across a range of differences from the average number of NGO barriers in an average country (with all independent variables held at their mean or modal values). Adding an additional barrier to advocacy beyond a country's average can reduce foreign aid commitments by more than $100 million in the following year. Though this amount is minuscule compared to the total amount of global foreign aid, measured in hundreds of billions of dollars (see the top left panel of @fig:dvs), it is sizable given the proportions being channeled as civil society aid. 

![Predicted ODA across a range of differences from average number of anti-NGO laws in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](../../Output/fig-predicted-h1){#fig:predicted-h1}

Why might barriers to advocacy have such an impact while other legal restrictions do not? Barriers to advocacy represent the harshest, most direct restrictions on NGO activity and include government intimidation or dissolution of undesirable organizations. Donors are more responsive to these more direct kinds of restrictions, either in an effort to punish recalcitrant countries or because the restricted legal environment makes it more difficult to operate in the country. Unlike benign bureaucratic legal barriers against funding or registration that just make it harder for NGOs to operate within a country, direct political intimidation and restriction both complicates NGO operations, and can even make it legally or politically impossible for donors to carry out certain projects. 

## Changes in aid contentiousness

We next turn to the purpose of the committed aid given by OECD donors. We hypothesize that donors will tame their aid, systematically shifting commitments away from more contentious issues like human rights, elections, media, and democratic participation, among others, in response to restrictive NGO laws. As described earlier, our dependent variable is the logit-transformed proportion of contentious to non-contentious aid in the following year. The results in @fig:coefs-h2 and in the appendix are reported as odds ratios, but the coefficients are not exactly comparable to odds ratio coefficients from logistic regression and other models based on binary outcomes. Following @TrippKang:2008, who use a similar transformation to model the proportion of women in legislatures, these coefficients represent the percentage change in the ratio of an in-group to an out-group, or the amount of contentious to non-contentious aid. Coefficient values below one indicate less contentious aid; values above one indicate more contentious aid.

![Determinants of the proportion of contentious OECD ODA in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 95% credible interval.](../../Output/fig-coefs-h2-bayes){#fig:coefs-h2}

With this model, few of the *within* coefficients have any substantial effect on the amount of contentious aid donors commit. The number of all anti-NGO barriers has no effect (P(\> 1) = 0.64), and the coefficient for barriers to entry individually has a slightly positive slope, but an uncertain probability of being greater than one (P(\> 1) = 0.90). Barriers to advocacy and entry, however, have a negative effects on contentious aid—countries that impose an additional barrier on advocacy have, on average, a 21% lower ratio of contentious aid to non-contentious aid (P(\> 1) = 0.03), while countries imposing additional barriers to funding see a 13% increase of contentious aid to non-contentious aid, all else equal (P(\> 1) = 0.95). The overall civil society regulatory environment plays an important role in the allocation of contentious aid: a one-point increase in the CSRE index is associated with an 8% higher ratio of contentious aid (P(\> 1) = 1). 

The time-invariant *between* coefficients in this model are instructive as well. Countries with more total legal barriers to funding have a substantially lower ratio of contentious aid (P(\> 1) = 0.04). None of the binary indicators of new NGO legislation have any impact, again suggesting that the overall level of restriction matters more than the imposition of new laws. 

Looking at the predicted proportion of contentious aid is helpful, given the difficulty in interpreting a percent change in ratios. @fig:predicted-h2 shows how the predicted proportion of contentious aid changes across a range of differences from both the average number of barriers to advocacy and the average CSRE index, with all other variables again helps at their typical values. While the distribution for the barriers to advocacy coefficient is not completely negative, it does trend downward, consistent with our hypothesis. Adding new restrictions on advocacy tends to reduce the amount of contentious aid donors allocate to countries. The CSRE, on the other hand, has a clear enabling effect on contentious aid. As the index improves, donors are far more likely to engage in more contentious programming and vice versa—as the legal environment deteriorates, donors appear to shift their commitments to less contentious programs.

![Predicted proportion of contentious OECD ODA across a range of differences from average number of anti-NGO laws in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](../../Output/fig-predicted-h2){#fig:predicted-h2}

These findings bolster Bush's claims [-@Bush:2015] that donors tame their programming when confronting dictators. Contentious NGOs are more likely to face legal restrictions on advocacy, and donors appear to react accordingly when those restrictions intensify. Importantly, how these laws are implemented also matters. Governments may pass restrictive anti-NGO legislations, but bureaucrats and government officials have discretion in how those laws are implemented. The negative effect of the CSRE hints that consistent implementation of civil society laws and a positive overall regulatory environment allows donors to engage in more contentious activities and protects against programmatic taming.

## Changes in aid channels

We also hypothesize that donors react to anti-NGO legislation by shifting their money away from international or US-based organizations to domestic NGOs, since the latter are less likely to viewed with suspicion by host countries and their citizens. Our dependent variable for this hypothesis is the proportion of aid channeled through domestic and foreign NGOs and is based on US foreign aid data since 2000 rather than all OECD countries since 1981. Coefficients should be interpreted again as the odds ratio of an in-group to an out-group—in this case, the proportion of aid to domestic NGOs (or foreign NGOs) to all other channels.

As seen in @fig:coefs-h3, adding an additional legal barrier beyond a country's average level is associated with *more* funding channeled through domestic NGOs, increasing the ratio by an average of 13% (P(\> 1) = 0.99). This effect seems to be driven primarily by barriers to funding, which is the only category of legal restriction to have a substantial *within* effect. On average, countries that enact an additional barrier to funding beyond their average level of regulation see a 35% higher ratio of aid channeled through domestic NGOs in the following year (P(\> 1) = 0.98). Barriers to entry has a sizable *between* effect, meaning that countries with more barriers to entry tend to have a higher ratio of aid channeled through domestic NGOs. No other NGO-related variables have a consistent effect on how much aid goes through domestic NGOs, though. 

![Determinants of the proportion of US foreign aid channeled through either domestic or foreign NGOs in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 95% credible interval.](../../Output/fig-coefs-h3-bayes){#fig:coefs-h3}

As would be expected given the increase in the use of domestic NGOs, the model finds that barriers to funding have a reverse effect on the proportion of aid given through foreign NGOs—countries enacting an additional barrier to funding see a 29% average decrease in the proportion of aid given to INGOs (P(\> 1) = 0.02). This is evident in @fig:predicted-h3, which shows the predicted proportion of aid to domestic and foreign NGOs across different degrees of funding restrictions. More aid is predicted to go to domestic NGOs as restrictions increase, but the proportion remains minuscule, increasing an average of 0.2% for each additional barrier. This is due, in part, to the fact that the baseline amount of aid channeled through domestic NGOs is inherently small, but it is also likely an artifact of the reduced data and the correspondingly more fragile model. The predicted proportion of aid given through foreign NGOs, however, is much more marked and substantial.

![Predicted proportion of US foreign aid channeled to domestic and foreign across a range of differences from average number of barriers to funding in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](../../Output/fig-predicted-h3){#fig:predicted-h3}

While the negative relationship between funding laws and aid channeled through foreign NGOs is logical, since the majority of funding laws are targeted at foreign actors, aid to domestic NGOs tends to increase relative to other channels in the face of these laws. There are at least two possible reasons for this. First, donors may think that these laws are being passed based on government perception of foreign influence in domestic politics. In order to assuage this perception, USAID may see more benefit in funding domestic NGOs rather than foreign NGOs. Second, in anticipation of increasing restrictions to civil society, USAID increases technical assistance to local civil society organizations (CSOs) in order to respond to restrictive regulatory proposals. The organization argues that respected CSOs not only assist diplomatic efforts to push for changes that are consistent with international standards, but also help spark local outrage [@USAID2014].


# Implications and conclusion

In this article, we look at how donors systematically respond to challenges put forth by recipient governments in channeling aid to NGOs. In particular, we look at the impact of anti-NGO regulation on the amount of aid channeled to countries, the targets of aid, and the purpose of aid based on its contentious nature. Analyzing 148 countries from 1981–2013, we find that increasing anti-NGO legal barriers, in particular, barriers to advocacy, decreases the amount of ODA channeled to that country. Besides reducing the amount of aid channeled to countries, donors also systematically redirect funds within restrictive countries, decreasing funds for politically sensitive causes, instead providing more aid to tame causes. These findings support recent research that donors, in particular, democracy assistance agencies, tame their programming when confronting dictators [@Bush:2015]. 

Finally, in the fact of increasing barriers to funding, donors increase the amount of aid given to domestic NGOs, while decreasing aid given to INGOs working in the restrictive countries. Since previous research has documented that governments often perceive foreign NGOs as external interference in domestic politics, increasing aid to domestic NGOs is likely to assuage these concerns. However, this finding is based on limited data by USAID over only a decade. This finding also reflects USAID's perception that increasing assistance to respected local NGOs can help the regulatory environment from worsening, as these local NGOs can help both diplomatic and lobbying efforts, as well as spark domestic outrage against restrictive legislation. 

Overall, by empirically showing that in response to restrictive anti-NGO legislation, donors either sale back their operations, or systematically redirect funds within restrictive countries to different causes or actors. Our results challenge existing conceptions of foreign aid in that such assistance often runs on autopilot. 

Our findings have three main implications for both donors and NGOs in developing countries. First, our results have worrying implications for the role of funders as external sources of democratization. Scott and Steele [-@ScottSteele, 63] argue that carefully targeted democracy assistance has a greater impact on democratization than general economic aid packages. However, increasing restrictions on NGOs, challenge the efficacy of such democracy assistance, especially since a majority of projects channeled under such programs can be viewed as contentious by governments.

Second, a reduction in funding may lead NGOs to turn towards government funding, which can potentially depoliticize their work. Prior literature has shown that organizations self-select into certain sources of funding based on ideology and goals [@BeyersEisingMaloney:2008; @Stroup2012]. Looking at the European Union, Bloodgood and Tremblay-Boire [-@BloodgoodTB, 2] find that increasing government funding to NGOs has a statistically significant and substantial effect on NGO lobbying expenditures. Thus, governments do not necessarily act in a politically benign fashion when they fund NGOs and government funding may indeed dampen political activities by these groups. 

Finally, local NGOs may need to invest in resources and manpower to mobilize local resources. Previous scholarly and practitioner work has emphasized that many NGOs have increasingly hired employees and devoted more resources to win foreign grants and contracts [@Bush:2015, 46–49]. Aside from debating the potential adverse effects of such competition and professionalization on the nature of work undertaken by NGOs, it may the case that such practices may not neatly carry over in attempting to procure funding domestically.

While we have outlined some of the broad strategies that donors can undertake in response to restrictive NGO legislation, these are by no means an exhaustive list of strategies. Funders may also undertake a number of other approaches such as increasing availability of emergency funds for recipients facing restrictions or exploring new partnerships with international business actors [@Carothers:2015, 23]—strategies that are not testable in a cross-national approach. Future qualitative work looking at these approaches can both examine a wider range of such strategies and determine their effectiveness. 

Finally, this paper has exclusively looked at how donors respond to changes in regulatory environments for NGOs. However, this environment is just one component of democratic backsliding [@Bermeo2016], and future research should also analyze the broader impact of this phenomenon, including the effects of the strategic manipulation of election or crackdown on media on donor funding decisions.

# Appendix

TODO: @fig:regulation-burden shows that since the 1990s, there has been an almost uniform increase in NGO registration requirements in both democracies and autocracies as governments routinized and streamlined state-NGO relations.[^regime] Thus, in this paper we primarily analyze the impact of restrictive legislations on donor behavior.
