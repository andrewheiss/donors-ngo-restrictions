    The last two decades have seen a proliferation of laws restricting NGOs throughout the world, resulting in an increasingly closed space for civil society. This crackdown on NGOs has been particularly acute in the Global South where states have imposed ever stricter regulations on foreign and domestic organizations. What is the effect of civil society restrictions on overall amounts of foreign aid, the targets of aid, and the nature of issues being funded? Looking at 148 countries from 1981–2013, we find we find that increasing anti-NGO legal barriers, in particular, barriers to advocacy, decrease the amount of foreign channeled to that country. Adding new restrictions on advocacy also tends to reduce the amount of contentious aid that donors allocate to those countries. In general, as the legal environment for NGOs improves, donors are more likely to engage in contentious programming. Finally, we find that additional barriers to funding actually leads USAID to grant more aid to domestic NGOs in restrictive countries. Our findings have strong implications not just for donors, but for the operation of domestic NGOs across the Global South and the sustainability of the civil society sector in these regions.

In 2013, an Egyptian court imposed jail sentences on 43 NGO employees for failing to comply with the civil society organization (CSO) law, which requires that NGOs obtain the approval of the Ministry of Social Solidarity before receiving funds from any foreign sources [@egypt-ngos-afp:2012]. Similarly, in 2014, the Indian government cancelled the licenses of over 9,000 NGOs, including prominent international groups such as the Ford Foundation and Greenpeace [@India9000]. This crackdown was initiated shortly after the government amended the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), targeting all non-profits receiving money from foreign sources and prohibiting those whose activities were 'political' in nature. 

The use of such restrictive NGO laws is not unique to the cases of Egypt and India. The last two decades have seen a proliferation of such laws, resulting in an increasingly closed space for civil society. According to data from the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, between 2004–10, more than 50 countries enacted measures restricting civil society [@Rutzen:2015]. More broadly, between 1990–2013, 79 developing countries introduced severe barriers to entry for NGOs, and 69 countries imposed some form of funding restriction on NGOs—whether in terms of limiting foreign funding or requiring that all money towards NGOs be channeled through government banks [@chaudhry2016]. While recent literature has examined the causes behind state crackdown on NGOs [@carothers2014; @DPR2016; @chaudhry2016; @Heiss:2016a], the consequences of this phenomenon have been relatively unexplored [@DupuyPrakash]. Therefore, in this paper we ask: What is the effect of civil society restrictions on donors and foreign aid patterns? Have donors reduced their funding for NGOs working on politically sensitive programming in more restrictive countries? Do trends in global philanthropy reflect donor responses to the legal repression of NGOs in the Global South?

Understanding the impact of NGO crackdown on donors and funding agencies is vital for two main reasons. First, international donors channel a large amount of aid to developing countries via NGOs. In particular, in states with poor governance records, donors prefer non-governmental mechanisms for transferring aid [@Dietrich2013], as this avoids problems such as corruption and incompetence. In 2012, USAID spent approximately $4.3 billion on assistance to civil society around the world, with the World Bank spending approximately $11 million on the same in 2009 [@tierney2011]. By imposing restrictions such as tougher barriers to entry for foreign-funded NGOs, prohibiting the operation of foreign-funded NGOs, and the prohibition of political activities by NGOs, restrictive states may deter donors. This crackdown can consequently lead to a decline in services offered to citizens in developing countries.

Second, restrictive NGO legislation may also negatively impact the development of robust civic associations, which are often seen as a crucial component for healthy democracies [@Putnam1994]. NGOs are often crucial in providing a voice to the grievances of citizens, particularly marginalized populations. To this end, US and European nations channel a large amount of democracy assistance towards civil society every year. Much of this assistance goes towards lobbying, advocacy, and mobilization around contentious areas such as human rights, elections, and party development—causes that are unlikely to be funded by the state. According to the International Human Rights Funders Group, in 2010, 703 foundations based in 29 countries made over 12,000 grants totaling $1.2 billion to 6,800 organizations worldwide [@DSL2013]. 

Without access to these funds, organizations in the Global South focusing on rights-based issues may cease to exist. This is due to lack of adequate domestic funding, owing to lower levels of per capita GDP and a weak local culture of philanthropy. Even for countries that have substantial wealth, a culture of charitable-giving to NGOs may not exist. For instance, over 90 per cent of human rights NGO activities in Israel are funded from Europe and America [@DPR2015]. Further, even when domestic philanthropists seek to provide money to NGOs, states can often coerce them to withhold their funding by threatening to not approve their business permits or withdrawing their tax exemptions. Finally, there are often differing understandings of human rights wherein people shy away from supporting causes that may be perceived as too political. Thus, a number of NGOs working in contentious issue areas may not be able to operate without financial assistance from abroad. 

In this article, we argue that states and donor agencies can first respond to the crackdown on NGOs by scaling back their operations. However, complete withdrawal due to the absence of non-governmental mechanisms for channeling aid, or leaving civil society actors to fend for themselves may not be an ideal long-term response. Therefore, we argue that in other cases, donors can respond to the global pushback by decreasing funds for politically sensitive causes, instead providing more aid for relatively tame causes. Further, they can also provide more aid to INGOs instead of NGOs, as well as aid to neighboring countries, enabling targets in the repressive state to function out of those territories instead. 

We find that increasing anti-NGO legal barriers, in particular, barriers to advocacy, decreases the amount of official development assistance (ODA) channeled to that country. Adding new restrictions on advocacy also tends to reduce the amount of contentious aid that donors allocate to those countries. In general, as the legal environment for NGOs improves, donors are more likely to engage in contentious programming. Such programming includes projects focused on government and civil society, conflict prevention and resolution, and peace and security—issues that focus on elections, human rights, women's empowerment, freedom of expression, and other matters that could potentially challenge more recalcitrant governments. We also find that in the face of increasing barriers to funding, aid to international NGOs does not increase; rather, such barriers actually increase aid to domestic NGOs. 

Below, we first look at existing literature on the determinants of different varieties of foreign aid, especially to NGOs. While this literature focuses extensively on the politics of donor countries, the politics of recipient countries, especially with regard to their civil society legislation, remains unexplored. We then elaborate on our theory regarding the effects of restrictive NGO legislation on bilateral and multilateral donors, how it impacts the nature of funds disbursed, and the kinds of targets that receive these funds. We test our hypotheses through a large-N statistical analysis by looking at changes in aid across 148 countries from 1981–2013. We conclude by analyzing the implications of our findings, particularly for domestic NGOs in the Global South.


# Foreign aid and civil society

Foreign aid by Western states to developing countries—via bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, and official development assistance—became a booming industry starting in the 1960s. Previous work has documented the importance of material resources in the form of grants, contracts, subsidies from states, and foundations, in explaining the growth and proliferation of NGOs all across the world [@Reimann2006]. Foreign aid has thus been steadily increasing—net ODA increased by 63% during 2000–10, reaching $128.5 billion in 2010 [@LMP2015]. More specifically, over the last two decades, ODA to social sector programs, including civil society promotion has increased relative to foreign aid directed at economic and production sectors. 

Moreover, donors prefer to channel funds via non-governmental mechanisms based on their perceptions of aid achieving its intended outcome [@Dietrich2013]. In particular, in countries with weak institutions and poor governance, where aid transfers raise issues of misuse and bureaucratic inefficiency, donors specifically seek out NGOs for projects. Previous research has also found that directly sending funds to recipient governments can result in numerous problems—by relaxing leaders' budget constraints, it can delay reforms needed for sustainable economic growth [@Easterly2006]. Direct provision of aid to governments may also promote rent-seeking among local elites [@gibson2005]. Thus, a large amount of Western funds and foreign aid is channeled towards NGOs in developing countries. 

US and Western European democracy promotion agencies and private donors also allocate large amounts of aid to NGOs overseas, as the strength of civic associations is often seen as a crucial determinant for democratization [@Putnam1994]. In most developing countries, however, this civil society empowerment strategy has focus entirely on NGOs, since these organizations are often viewed as the most visible and easy-to-reach organizations within civil society. Further, as Ottoway and Carothers point out, 

> [a] central assumption of civil society aid carried out under the auspices of democracy promotion is that advocacy NGOs are a critical segment, perhaps the critical segment, of civil society, at least with regard to democratization. The assumption stems from the belief that the advocacy functions of those groups necessarily engages key democratic processes such as representing interests, challenging the state, and fostering citizens' participation in ways that other kinds of civil society activities do not [@OttawayCarothers:2000, 295].

Therefore, aid providers from most donor countries and democracy-promoting organizations often end up concentrating on a very narrow set of civil society organizations, namely NGOs.

Despite being the preferred actor of the international community for the above-explained reasons, many states have enacted numerous restrictions against NGOs. Recent research analyzing the causes behind this crackdown has argued that, in many cases, foreign funding is seen as providing resources to political opponents [@DPR2016; @carothers2014]. More broadly, @chaudhry2016 finds that while violent crackdown is useful against NGOs posing immediate threats, states cannot use violence against all NGOs, as doing so may reduce the state's legitimacy, violate human rights treaties, and further mobilize the population against the regime. Therefore, in the long term, states prefer restrictive NGO legislation. This is particularly the case when NGOs challenge key economic interests of a state, influence electoral participation, or threaten mobilization. Legal restrictions obfuscate the negative consequences associated with violence. Restrictions are particularly useful against international NGOs, since violence against foreign NGOs and employees can have more dire consequences for the repressive state compared to when repressing its own citizens. Finally, once implemented, legal restrictions effectively bar the activities of a broad range of NGOs, even those that may not be perceived to be posing a threat now, but can potentially be costly in the future. 
 
Given the advantages of using restrictive legislation over violence, states have increasingly turned to NGO regulation. How does restrictive NGO legislation impact the foreign aid sector, private donors, and democracy promotion community? While previous research has shown that domestic politics of donor countries are among the main determinants of foreign aid [@MilnerTingley2010], there is comparatively little research on how domestic politics of recipient countries affects donor decisions. Rather, the needs of recipient countries has been considered the primary factor in aid allocation [@AlesinaDollar2010; @Dreher2009; @EasterlyPfutze2008]. 

However, in studies that look at how target country characteristics determine the distribution of aid, findings related to donor attitudes of how recipient governments respect civil and political rights remain inconclusive. @svensson1999 finds that government respect for political and civic rights has a positive impact upon whether a country receives any aid at all from Canada, Japan, and the US, but not from Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and the UK. @Neumayer:2003, looking particularly at bilateral aid allocation, finds that respect for civil and political rights plays a statistically significant role for almost all aid donors on whether a country is deemed eligible for receipt of aid. Further, low regulatory burden is statistically significant and substantively strong in determining level of aid for good governance. Respect for personal integrity rights is insignificant at best and exerts a positive influence on aid eligibility at worst. However, @poe1992 and @PoeTate1994 find that US aid allocation takes personal integrity rights violations into account. Thus, the foreign aid literature remains inconclusive about whether concerns about crackdown on NGOs factor into donor decisions regarding the channeling of foreign aid via non-state actors. 

@DupuyPrakash, looking at the effects of the adoption of restrictive NGO finance laws, find that it is associated with a 32% decline in bilateral aid inflows in subsequent years. On the other hand, multilateral donors and overseas diaspora do not reduce aid in response to such restrictive funding laws. While @DupuyPrakash lay the necessary groundwork for understanding the consequences of state repression of NGOs, their study is limited to a subset of what we analyze in this article—they concentrate on new laws that restrict the inflow of foreign funds to domestically operating NGOs. In contrast, here we analyze a wide variety of laws beyond barriers to funding, including barriers to association, entry, and advocacy.

Besides affecting NGOs in the short-run, restrictive legislation can influence NGO operations in the long-run in two main ways. First, a reduction in funding other states and IGOs may lead NGOs to turn towards government funding, which can potentially depoliticize their work. Prior literature has shown that organizations self-select into certain sources of funding based on ideology and goals [@BeyersEisingMaloney:2008]. As @Stroup2012 points out, there is a relationship between income source and selection of activities, and human rights INGOs are less willing to accept government funding to maintain credibility. Looking at the European Union's Transparency Register, @BloodgoodTB find that increasing government funding to NGOs has a statistically significant and substantial effect on NGO lobbying expenditures. They argue that governments do not necessarily act in a politically benign fashion when they fund NGOs and government funding may indeed dampen political activities by these groups. Their results suggest that NGOs engaging in political activities may need to be privately funded in order to serve a full range of political functions.

Second, increasing dependence on government funding and funding from domestic forces can impact the nature of issue areas on which NGOs focus. Describing the nature of state-civil society relationships in China, @Teets2014 argues that the Chinese government not just allows, but encourages NGOs working in areas such as public health, environmental protection, education reform, and disaster relief. However, in doing so, the state focuses on service delivery rather than policy advocacy, and better governance, rather than democratization, is the desired goal.


# Theory

In the 1990s and 2000s, the issue of restrictive NGO legislation had not reached ubiquitous or severe proportions, but this is no longer the case. However, it is important to emphasize that not all NGO regulation is necessarily restrictive in nature—some regulations seek to increase rights and access to the policy-making process [@btb2016]. @Teets2014, describing what she terms 'consultative authoritarianism', or the new model of state-civil society relationships in China, argues that this model allows more participation by NGOs in the policy process, while creating new tools of state control. @fig:regulation-burden shows that since the 1990s, there has been an almost uniform increase in NGO registration requirements in both democracies and autocracies as governments routinized and streamlined state-NGO relations.[^regime] 

However, the restrictiveness of these laws varies by regime type—autocracies have been far more likely to make these regulations burdensome and opaque. @chaudhry2016 finds that while many states have made it mandatory for NGOs to register in their territories, very often these requirements are not straightforward: approval times are lengthy, NGOs may not be allowed appeals in denied registration, and some countries require an unreasonably large number of founders in order to register. @Heiss:2016b also finds that international NGOs face more arbitrary restrictions like payroll taxes and employment laws targeted at organizations that hire foreign workers. Thus, in this paper we do not only look at laws that can be considered routine regulation—we also analyze the impact of laws that can be considered repressive.

![Proportion of countries with laws that require NGO registration and that impose additional burdens on the registration process](../../Output/fig-regulation-burden){#fig:regulation-burden}

Given the wide range of funders and NGOs that are affected by this global crackdown, we hypothesize that state and private donors can respond to increasingly repressive NGO legislation in two broad ways—they can either scale back their operations, or they can respond to this pushback in a number of other ways, so that indigenous civil society in developing countries is not completely bereft of external assistance. 

## Scaling back

In response to the crackdown on NGOs, we first hypothesize that bilateral and multilateral donors who channel funds via NGOs to developing countries may end up reducing aid. This is because of two main reasons. First, critics may believe that aid will be effective only if delivered through non-governmental mechanisms. Without this option, donors may want to channel funds directly to recipient governments and may end up reducing their total aid. Second, restrictive NGO legislation almost implies a declining respect for civil and political rights in the target state. Therefore, donors may choose to channel democracy assistance towards civil society groups in countries that are in a better position to utilize these funds. Therefore, we can expect to see a decline in bilateral transfers and official development assistance to countries that pass restrictive NGO legislation. 

> **H~1~**: In response to restrictive NGO legislation, bilateral, multilateral, and private donors may reduce their aid to the repressive countries.

## Responding to the global pushback

However, it is unlikely that states, inter-governmental organizations, and funding agencies will simply scale back their operations when faced with repressive legislation in target countries. In many cases, donors—both state and private—are actively working to find solutions and develop responses to help besieged local NGOs in the Global South. Further, as @Carothers:2015 points out, scaling back is sometimes only visible with the actual departure of funders from the country. For instance, following the 2015 Undesirable Organizations Law, a large number of funding organizations such as the MacArthur Foundation and the National Democratic Institute were asked to leave Russia. In cases that are not as high-profile, it is more likely that we should observe subtle changes. We emphasize three such changes. 

First, we expect that donors should change the nature of the causes that they support and the organizations that they work with. This is because of two main reasons. First, with increasing restrictions on the nature of activities undertaken by NGOs, donors may find it difficult to identify local NGOs that still work on contentious issue areas such as human rights, elections, political parties, youth groups, and advocacy. Second, with increasing state rhetoric against civil society groups that threaten the security and sovereignty of the state, donors may find it more politically appropriate to increase the amount of funding for 'tame' causes such as education, health, and social service provision [@Bush:2015].

> **H~2~**: As restrictive legislation against NGOs is enacted, donors increase funds for "tamer" causes and decrease funds for politically sensitive causes

Second, due to constraints on registration, funding, and the nature of activities undertaken by local NGOs, donor officials may also be more likely to turn to relevant INGOs in order to perform the same task. Previous research by @Bush2016 has shown that American donor officials actually strongly prefer American NGOs in implementing programming abroad. This is because American NGOs are easier to observe, are more likely to share donors' preferences, and may also mitigate potential implementation problems, making it easier for donors to monitor progress and receive reports.

> **H~3~**: As restrictive legislation against local NGOs increases, states are more likely to provide aid to INGOs rather than local NGOs

Third, in response to draconian NGO laws, donors may instead start providing more aid to neighboring countries. For instance, following the Russian Foreign Agent law and the Undesirable Organizations Law in 2015 that led to the closure of thousands of domestic NGOs, as well as international groups such as the MacArthur Foundation, the National Democratic Institute, and Human Rights Watch, the Prague Civil Society Center has emerged as a bastion to train and coordinate civil society efforts in Russia. Similarly, prior to the 2011 Tunisian Jasmine Revolution, the repressive environment for civil society groups led the international community to fund and manage some politically sensitive activities from neighboring countries such as Jordan and Morocco [@Bush:2015, 192].

Indeed, previous research by @BBCM2014 has found that cross-border activism can play a key role in non-violent protest, sparking political change and democratization. This is particularly so if domestic human rights organizations within a state are not flourishing. Thus, donors—both state and private—may believe that shifting away from having a direct presence in a country implementing restrictive laws is more likely to achieve organizational goals. They may move offices to the neighboring countries or hold training in adjacent countries, for example.

> **H~4~**: As restrictive legislation against NGOs in a country are enacted, donors are more likely to provide aid to neighboring countries


# Data and methods

We analyze donor reactions to state crackdown of NGOs by looking at how foreign aid has changed in response to anti-NGO legislation. We combine variables from several existing datasets and create a cross-sectional time series panel that includes information about aid and NGO legislation in 148 countries from 1981–2013.[^1] Summary statistics for all the variables we use in our models are provided in @tbl:var-summary.

## Dependent variables

We measure foreign aid using the OECD's detailed data on aid commitments, which includes all overseas development assistance (ODA) from OECD member countries and multilateral organizations. Following guidance from the OECD,[^oecd] we use *commitment* amounts rather than actual *disbursement* amounts since disbursement data moves slowly and does not necessarily reflect responses to the political environment—projects take a long time to fulfill and actual inflows of aid in a year can be tied to commitments made years before. Because we are interested in donor reactions to restrictions on NGOs, any reaction would be visible in the decision to commit money to aid, not in the ultimate disbursement of aid, which is already legally obligated and allocated to the country regardless of changes in civil society restrictions. For our first hypothesis, we calculate the sum of OECD-based ODA committed to each country each year since 1981 (in constant 2011 US dollars), representing nearly $5.5 trillion in total assistance (see the top left panel of @fig:dvs). 

![**Top left (H~1~, H~4~)**: total overseas development assistance (ODA) committed to all countries; **top right (H~2~)**: proportion of OECD ODA committed to contentious programs; **bottom left**: total US foreign aid committed to all countries; **bottom right (H~3~)**: proportion of US foreign aid channeled through different types of NGOs](../../Output/fig-dvs){#fig:dvs}

Aid data from the OECD includes detailed information about the purposes of each grant or project undertaken, which we use to test our second hypothesis. The OECD assigns projects to one of more than 200 different purpose codes in dozens of broader categories such as health, education, and agriculture. We classify contentious aid as any project focused on government and civil society[^2] or conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security,[^3] which include projects focused on elections, human rights, women's empowerment, freedom of expression, and other issues that could potentially challenge more recalcitrant governments. Nearly $300 million has been allocated for this more aggressive kind of aid since 1980, accounting for more than 10% of all OECD-based foreign aid since 2009 (see the top right panel of @fig:dvs). 

In our third hypothesis, we posit that more aid will be allocated to international or US-based NGOs than domestic NGOs in response to harsher anti-NGO restrictions. The OECD unfortunately does not uniformly categorize each aid project by delivery channel, which makes it impossible to systematically determine which kinds of organizations receive money. USAID, on the other hand, offers more granular data about the channels through which aid is delivered. We generate several variables indicating the proportion of American foreign aid channeled through domestic, international, and US-based NGOs. Notably, however, our tests of this hypothesis are based solely on American aid and thus represent only a subset of OECD donor behavior. We consider the total amount of economic aid from 26 different US government agencies in each country annually, as reported in the agency's Green Book, comprising $519 billion since 1981, and $248 billion since 2000 (see the bottom left panel of @fig:dvs). As is evident in the bottom right panel of @fig:dvs, almost no aid was allocated to NGOs before 2000—due to changes in reporting standards, nearly all aid reported by USAID was delivered solely by the United States government until 2000. As such, we also limit our analysis to 2001–2013, adding additional caveats to the interpretation of this hypothesis.

Finally, in our fourth hypothesis, we propose that donors shift aid to neighboring countries in response to anti-NGO legislation. We calculate the total ODA in each country's neighbors, defined as all states within 900 km of the closest border, which provides a more accurate sense of a country's neighbors than simply looking at shared contiguous borders [@Gleditsch:2002].

To capture the lagged effect of each explanatory variable on amount of aid in a given year, we shift our different measures of foreign aid ahead by one year (instead of lagging all the explanatory variables individually). As a robustness check we also include models with aid leaded by two years and five years and find similar results. For the sake of modeling, we transform our measures of aid differently for each hypothesis: when looking at total aid amounts, we take the natural log of aid; when looking at proportions of aid, we use a logit transformation and add or subtract 0.001 from values that are exactly 0 or 1. @eq:all-models-dvs lists the simplified functional forms for each hypothesis.

## Explanatory variables

We are primarily interested in donor reactions to restrictive NGO legislation, which we measure in a few different ways. First, we use data from @chaudhry2016 and @christensen2013, who track the presence or absence of fifteen different NGO-related laws across 148 countries[^4]. These laws are categorized by purpose and encompass barriers to association, entry, funding, and advocacy. We create summative indexes for the laws in each of these categories (see @tbl:ngo-barriers-index), as well as binary variables that indicate if a new law in a category was passed in a given year. The NGO legislation data indicates only the year of initial appearance of a legal barrier, so we carry the inverse of the first known value backwards (e.g. because Albania did not require NGO registration until 2001, it is coded as 0 until that year). As can be seen in the left panel of @fig:barriers, on average countries have eliminated barriers to association through constitutional and legal reforms, but have steadily increased the number of barriers to entry, funding, and advocacy. In particular, the average number of barriers to funding has increased more rapidly than other barriers since 2000.

\normalsize

An alternative method for measuring civil society restrictions is to look at the overall civil society regulatory environment instead of specific laws, since *de jure* legislation does not always reflect the *de facto* restrictions. NGO laws are not inherently restrictive. Most states are increasingly routinizing their regulation of NGOs, as seen previously in @fig:regulation-burden. In authoritarian states, where burdensome laws are more likely, NGO regulations are often enforced with discretion and are targeted at specific organizations in conflict with the government. Actual laws can lie dormant until needed for repression. For instance, Russia passed the Undesirable Organizations law of 2015 with the purpose of targeting and eliminating specific foreign-connected NGOs it deemed dangerous. One of the law's sponsors, Aleksandr Tarnavsky, described the law as a preventative measure that would not affect the majority of NGOs working in Russia. Rather, the law would be a "weapon hanging on the wall… that never fires" and stand as a warning to potentially uncooperative NGOs [@Kozenko:2015]. Simply counting laws therefore misses the effect of their de facto implementation—laws could be benignly routine, dangerously dormant, or outrightly restrictive. 

To address this disconnect, @Heiss:2016a developed a new civil society regulatory environment index (CSRE), which combines two civil society indexes from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project [@VDEM]: (1) civil society repression and (2) civil society entry and exit regulations. The CSRE index ranges from roughly −6 to 6 (though typically only from −4 to 4), and shows more variation over time since it ostensibly captures changes in the implementation of the regulatory environment rather than the presence or absence of legislation. The right panel of @fig:barriers shows how the average global CSRE index has changed over time, and the trends tend to match changes in legislation—the CSRE reflects the decline in barriers to association in the 1990s. At the same time, since the CSRE captures the effects of the implementation of laws, it shows a marked drop in 2012 and 2013, which is not reflected in the overall count of NGO legislation, possibly because of discretionary enforcement. While the main focus of this paper is donor response to new legislation, we also look at donor response to changes in the overall CSRE as a robustness check.

## Controls

As explained previously, an active and contentious literature has long debated what determines how much foreign aid donors allocate to countries. Research has found that donors give more to smaller, poorer countries that share former colonial or present diplomatic ties [@Neumayer:2003; @AndersenHansenMarkussen:2006; @MilnerTingley2010], or that suffer from internal conflict, natural disasters, and other unexpected shocks [@Raddatz:2007; @DesaiKharas:2010; @BezerraBraithwaite:2016]. Other factors play less of a role, such as a country's military spending, respect for personal integrity rights, regime type, domestic instability, political ideology, or quality of governance [@Neumayer:2003a; @Neumayer:2003b; @DesaiKharas:2010]. Since it is impossible to efficiently control for every possible factor when determining the effect of NGO restrictions on aid decisions, we control for four general themes found in previous research: democracy, wealth, government capacity, and unexpected shocks. 

We control for the level of *democracy* in a country based on the understanding that donors consider the ability of recipient governments and democratic institutions to utilize aid flows. We measure democratization using data from Polity IV [@PolityIV], rescaled from 0–10, with 10 being most democratic. We also include a binary indicator marking years after 1989 to account for differences in post-Cold War foreign aid. Since we believe that a country's wealth and aid dependence influences donation decisions, we measure a country's *wealth* in two ways, both based on GDP, trade, and population measures from the UN and World Bank: (1) GDP per capita, measured in constant 2011 US dollars, and (2) the amount of trade—both imports and exports—as a percent of GDP. 

An alternative strand in the foreign aid literature argues that the decision to channel money via NGOs or governments is reflective of the funder's belief in the capacity of either actor to get the job done. In countries with weak or corrupt state institutions, donors expect a higher probability of aid capture and consequently want to channel more funds via NGOs [@Dietrich2013]. Given the influence of *government capacity* in donor decision making, we include the political corruption index from V-Dem [@McMannPemsteinSeim:2016], which accounts for public sector, executive, legislative, and judicial corruption, and ranges from 0–10, with 10 being most corrupt. Finally, we include two measures of *unexpected shocks*, based on the idea that more deaths and damages from natural disasters or internal armed conflict may prompt donors to provide aid for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. We measure the occurrence of natural disasters with a binary indicator from the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT) [@EMDAT], marking whether or not a disaster occurred in a given year, and we use data from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict dataset [@gleditsch2002] to indicate the presence of an internal conflict in the past five years.

Foreign aid exhibits significant serial correlation, since the current year's level of aid is dependent on previous commitments. To account for this, we include the value of the dependent variable (i.e. aid, proportion of contentious aid, etc.) in the previous year as a final control.

## Missing values

The bulk of our new dataset has complete data for every variable in each country-year observation, with only a few variables from V-Dem and the World Bank suffering from missing data: Polity IV, the political corruption index, the civil society regulatory index, population, and GDP. These variables are not missing at random—most of the missing data can be attributable to a lack of consistent reporting. In an effort to avoid the listwise deletion of these important control variables, we employ Bayesian multiple imputation using Honaker, King, and Blackwell's [-@HonakerKingBlackwell:2011] *Amelia II*. Following @KingHonakerJoseph:2001, we estimate individual regression models across five imputed datasets and then meld and combine the resulting estimates and standard errors.[^5]

## Modeling strategy

We account for country and year effects to distinguish between natural time-variant and country-specific changes in donor behavior and actual donor reactions to increased NGO restrictions. Typical time-series-cross-sectional data analysis includes these variables as fixed effects to control out issues of heterogeneity within units. However, @BellJones:2015 forcefully (and convincingly) argue that fixed effects models eliminate too much variance and make it impossible to measure the effects of time-invariant (or slowly-variant) variables. Random effects (or multilevel) models, when properly specified, overcome these issues by decomposing the effects of variables to within- and between-effects (or time-variant and time-invariant effects). Following Bell and Jones, we use crossed random effects multilevel models for both country and year and decompose each continuous variable into meaned and demeaned forms by calculating the average value of that variable within a country and subtracting that mean from each individual observation. More formally, as seen in @eq:re-within-between, the $\beta_1$ coefficient represents the value for the demeaned variable ($x_{it} - \bar{x}_i$) and corresponds to the time-variant effect of that variable *within* an individual country (i.e. how $x$ influences $y$ over time). $\beta_2$, on the other hand, represents the value for the mean of the variable ($\bar{x}_i$) and corresponds to the time-*in*variant effect of that variable *between* all countries (i.e. how the general level of $x$ is associated with $y$ across all countries). 

$$ y_{i, t + 1} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (x_{it} - \bar{x}_i) + \beta_2 \bar{x}_i + \ldots $$ {#eq:re-within-between}

While this model specification is at first a little unwieldy, it has multiple benefits. The coefficients for demeaned (or *within*) variables in this kind of random effects model are roughly equivalent to their corresponding coefficients in a fixed effects model, and are thus generally the coefficients of interest. These coefficients can be interpreted like standard regression coefficients: on average, accounting for differences over time, a unit change in $x_t$ in a given country corresponds to a $\beta_1$ change in $y_{t+1}$. The *between* effects, on the other hand, reflect the cross-sectional variance and do not indicate changes in variable values. Instead, these coefficients show how the average level of each explanatory variable is related to the dependent variable: on average, countries with higher (or lower) $x$ tend to have higher (or lower) $y$. Fixed effects models assume that these between coefficients are zero, which leads to Bell and Jones's primary criticism of fixed effects regression—too much between-unit variance is swallowed up by fixed effects and helpful information is lost. A random effects model specified in this manner clearly separates the within from the between effects.

We use models with split *within* and *between* covariates and crossed country and year random effects for our first three hypotheses. The unit of analysis in our fourth hypothesis is slightly different, however, since it is the sum of all a country's neighbors and correspondingly double counts the variation of countries (e.g. the variable for both Rwanda and Burundi includes aid to Uganda). As such, we omit country-level random effects and include random effects only for year.

Finally, we test our hypotheses using a series of Bayesian regression models, rather than frequentist null hypothesis significance tests (NHST). Bayesian methods yield more meaningful inferences [@Kruschke:2015; @Korner-NievergeltRothFelten:2015; @GelmanCarlinStern:2013]: whereas NHST analysis determines the *probability of the data* given a *null hypothesis* (i.e. $P(\text{data} | H_0)$), Bayesian analysis determines the *probability of a hypothesis* given *the data* (i.e. $P(H | \text{data})$). Bayesian models return full posterior probability distributions for each parameter instead of simple point estimates, meaning that the probability of a given hypothesis can be calculated directly and corresponds to the proportion of the posterior distribution that falls on either side of zero [@Galantucci:2014; @Gill:2014]. For each model variable, we report the posterior median, the proportion of the distribution that is greater than zero (or the probability), and the 95% credible interval, or the range of the posterior distribution that has a 95% chance of containing the true value of the estimated coefficient.[^stan] 


# Results and analysis

We present the estimates of our different models in coefficient plots below. Since there are many control variables, and most are doubled up with *within* and *between* effects, we only include variables related to the NGO regulatory environment in each plot. The full results of all models are included in the appendix, and @tbl:findings-summary summarizes the main findings for each hypothesis.

## Changes in overall aid

We first look at how anti-NGO legal barriers affect ODA in the following year (see @fig:coefs-h1). The total number of legal barriers has a negative effect on foreign aid—adding a new barrier or law beyond a country's average level of laws is associated with a 7% reduction in aid in the next year (P(\> 0) = 0.05). It appears that the overall number of barriers matters more than simply increasing legal restrictions, since the binary indicator for adding a new legal barrier has no substantial influence on aid. When we disaggregate the effect of different types of restrictions, we find that donors seem to respond primarily to advocacy barriers. Increasing limitations on advocacy beyond a country's average level is associated with a 46% drop in aid the following year, on average (P(\> 0) = 0.04). Barriers to entry and barriers to funding do not influence aid, however. This relationship holds when looking at the binary addition of laws—aid decreases by 104% in the year following the passage of a new barrier to advocacy (P(\> 0) = 0.05), but does not change when adding other legal restrictions. Finally, the overall civil society regulatory environment does not have any effect on foreign aid in the following year. Almost none of the between effects are different from zero, with one exception: countries with more legal barriers to entry tend to have higher levels of aid (P(\> 0) = 0.98).

![Determinants of OECD ODA in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 95% credible interval.](../../Output/fig-coefs-h1-bayes){#fig:coefs-h1}

The substantive impact of these coefficients can be seen in @fig:predicted-h1, which shows the predicted level of foreign aid across 500 draws from the posterior distribution across a range of differences from the average number of NGO barriers in an average country (with all independent variables held at their mean or modal values). Adding an additional barrier to advocacy beyond a country's average can reduce foreign aid commitments by nearly $100 million in the following year. Though this amount is minuscule compared to the total amount of global foreign aid, measured in hundreds of billions of dollars (see the top left panel of @fig:dvs), it is sizable given the proportions being channeled as civil society aid. 

![Predicted ODA across a range of differences from average number of anti-NGO laws in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](../../Output/fig-predicted-h1){#fig:predicted-h1}

Why might barriers to advocacy have such an impact while other legal restrictions do not? Barriers to advocacy represent the harshest, most direct restrictions on NGO activity and include government intimidation or dissolution of undesirable organizations. Donors are more responsive to these more direct kinds of restrictions, either in an effort to punish recalcitrant countries or because the restricted legal environment makes it more difficult to operate in the country. It appears that donors are influenced more by direct political intimidation and restriction than by more benign bureaucratic legal barriers against funding or registration.

## Changes in aid contentiousness

We next turn to the purpose of the committed aid given by OECD donors. We hypothesize that donors will tame their aid, shifting commitments away from more contentious issues like human rights and democracy promotion, in response to restrictive NGO laws. As described earlier, our dependent variable is the logit-transformed proportion of contentious to non-contentious aid in the following year. The results in @fig:coefs-h2 and in the appendix are reported as odds ratios, but the coefficients are not exactly comparable to odds ratio coefficients from logistic regression and other models based on binary outcomes. Following @TrippKang:2008, who use a similar transformation to model the proportion of women in legislatures, these coefficients represent the percentage change in the ratio of an in-group to an out-group, or the amount of contentious to non-contentious aid. Coefficient values below one indicate less contentious aid; values above one indicate more contentious aid.

![Determinants of the proportion of contentious OECD ODA in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 95% credible interval.](../../Output/fig-coefs-h2-bayes){#fig:coefs-h2}

With this model, few of the *within* coefficients have any substantial effect on the amount of contentious aid donors commit. The number of all anti-NGO barriers has no effect (P(\> 1) = 0.74), and both barriers to entry and barriers to funding individually have slightly positive slopes, but uncertain probabilities of being greater than one (P(\> 1) = 0.92; P(\> 1) = 0.81). Barriers to advocacy, however, have a negative effect on contentious aid—countries that impose an additional barrier on advocacy have, on average, a 17% lower ratio of contentious aid to non-contentious aid, all else equal (P(\> 1) = 0.06). The overall civil society regulatory environment plays an important role in the allocation of contentious aid: a one-point increase in the CSRE index is associated with an 8% higher ratio of contentious aid (P(\> 1) = 1). The time-invariant *between* coefficients in this model are instructive as well. Countries with more total legal barriers against NGOs tend to have a lower ratio of contentious aid in the next year (P(\> 1) = 0.04), and this variation is driven primarily by barriers to funding—countries that impose legal barriers to funding have a substantially lower ratio of contentious aid (P(\> 1) = 0). None of the binary indicators of new NGO legislation have any impact, again suggesting that the overall level of restriction matters more than the imposition of new laws. 

Looking at the predicted proportion of contentious aid is helpful, given the difficulty in interpreting a percent change in ratios. @fig:predicted-h2 shows how the predicted proportion of contentious aid changes across a range of differences from both the average number of barriers to advocacy and the average CSRE index, with all other variables again helps at their typical values. While the distribution for the barriers to advocacy coefficient is not completely negative, it does trend downward, consistent with our hypothesis. Adding new restrictions on advocacy tends to reduce the amount of contentious aid donors allocate to countries. The CSRE, on the other hand, has a clear enabling effect on contentious aid. As the index improves, donors are far more likely to engage in more contentious programming and vice versa—as the legal environment deteriorates, donors appear to shift their commitments to less contentious programs. 

![Predicted proportion of contentious OECD ODA across a range of differences from average number of anti-NGO laws in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](../../Output/fig-predicted-h2){#fig:predicted-h2}

These findings bolster Bush's claims [-@Bush:2015] that donors tame their programming when confronting dictators. Limits on advocacy matter (to some extent). More contentious NGOs, such as those involved in democracy promotion, are more likely to face legal restrictions on advocacy, and donors appear to react accordingly when those restrictions intensify. Importantly, how these laws are implemented also matters. Governments pass laws and regulations, but bureaucrats and government officials have discretion in how those laws are implemented. The negative effect of the CSRE hints that consistent implementation of civil society laws and a positive overall regulatory environment allows donors to engage in more contentious activities and protects against programmatic taming.

## Changes in aid channels

We also hypothesize that donors react to anti-NGO legislation by shifting their money away from domestic NGOs in the countries they work in and turning more toward international or US-based organizations that are more easily monitored and that might align more closely with the culture and values of the donor country. Our dependent variable for this hypothesis is the proportion of aid channeled through domestic and foreign NGOs and is based on US foreign aid data since 2000 rather than all OECD countries since 1981. Coefficients should be interpreted again as the odds ratio of an in-group to an out-group—in this case, the proportion of aid to domestic NGOs (or foreign NGOs) to all other channels.

As seen in @fig:coefs-h3, adding an additional legal barrier beyond a country's average level is associated with *more* funding channeled through domestic NGOs, increasing the ratio by an average of 11% (P(\> 1) = 0.99). This effect seems to be driven primarily by barriers to entry, which is the only category of legal restriction to have a substantial *within* effect. On average, countries that enact an additional barrier to funding beyond their average level of regulation see a 25% higher ratio of aid channeled through domestic NGOs in the following year (P(\> 1) = 0.97). Barriers to entry has a sizable *between* effect, meaning that countries with more barriers to entry tend to have a higher ratio of aid channeled through domestic NGOs. No other NGO-related variables have a consistent effect on how much aid goes through domestic NGOs, though. 

![Determinants of the proportion of US foreign aid channeled through either domestic or foreign NGOs in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 95% credible interval.](../../Output/fig-coefs-h3-bayes){#fig:coefs-h3}

Importantly, this same model does not find that anti-NGO laws, in any specification, have any substantial effects on the proportion of aid channeled through foreign NGOs. The overall number of legal barriers—and barriers to funding specifically—is negatively associated with a *decrease* in the ratio of aid given through foreign NGOs, as would be expected given the increase in the use of domestic NGOs. This effect, however, is insubstantial. This is particularly evident in @fig:predicted-h3, which shows the predicted proportion of aid to domestic and foreign NGOs across different degrees of funding restrictions. More aid is predicted to go to domestic NGOs as restrictions increase, but the proportion remains minuscule, increasing an average of 0.2% for each additional barrier. This is due, in part, to the fact that the baseline amount of aid channeled through domestic NGOs is inherently small, but it is also likely an artifact of the reduced data and the correspondingly more fragile model. Similarly, the model finds a negative effect on the proportion of aid given to foreign NGOs. The predicted proportion shows this negative effect, but there is wide variance throughout the simulations, resulting in no substantial effect.

![Predicted proportion of US foreign aid channeled to domestic and foreign across a range of differences from average number of barriers to funding in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](../../Output/fig-predicted-h3){#fig:predicted-h3}

Does this mean there is no effect of anti-NGO laws on how donors use NGOs to channel their aid? Perhaps. In some circumstances, foreign funding laws can lead to more funding for domestic NGOs, contrary to our hypothesis. There are at least two possible reasons for this. First, donors may think that these laws are being passed based on government perception of foreign influence in domestic politics. In order to assuage this perception, USAID may see more benefit in funding domestic NGOs rather than foreign NGOs. Second, in anticipation of increasing restrictions to civil society, USAID claims to increase technical assistance to local civil society organizations (CSOs) in order to respond to restrictive regulatory proposals. They posit that respected CSOs not only assist diplomatic efforts to push for changes that are consistent with international standards, but also help spark local outrage [@USAID2014]. However, given the limits of the data and the weakness of the findings, this hypothesis is inconclusive.

## Changes in aid to neighboring countries

Finally, do donors react to anti-NGO laws by shifting money to neighboring countries? Our dependent variable for this hypothesis is the natural log of total aid from OECD donors given to all countries within 900 km of a country. As explained previously, we do not use country random effects or coefficients split by their *within* and *between* effects in this model specification because of the cross-national nature of our dependent variable. 

![Determinants of the proportion of OECD ODA given to all countries within 900 km of a given country in the following year. Points indicate posterior medians; error bars indicate 95% credible interval.](../../Output/fig-coefs-h4-bayes){#fig:coefs-h4}

@fig:coefs-h4 presents the estimates from these final models. Contrary to our hypothesis, the addition of a new legal barrier in a given year seems to decrease the amount of aid given to neighboring countries by 13% (P(\> 0) = 0.01). However, when decomposed, no specific type of barrier—advocacy, entry, or funding—drives this effect. Additionally, the overall civil society regulatory environment has no effect on the amount of aid given to neighbors. This absence of effect can also be seen in the predicted amount of neighbor aid (see @fig:predicted-h4). While the amount of aid given to the rest of a country's neighborhood decreases as the total number of anti-NGO barriers increases, no specific type of barrier really explains that effect.

![Predicted amount of OECD ODA given to neighboring countries across a range of hypothetical anti-NGO barriers in an average country; dark line shows average of 500 draws from posterior distribution.](../../Output/fig-predicted-h4){#fig:predicted-h4}

We do not find much evidence to support this hypothesis and believe that the one positive finding is likely spurious. We need to find a better approach to test this hypothesis.


# Implications and conclusion

In this article, we analyzed the impact of increasingly restrictive NGO legislation and restrictive regulatory environments on the amount of aid channeled to countries, the targets of aid, and the purpose of aid based on its contentious nature. Looking at 148 countries from 1981–2013, we find, as hypothesized by our theory, that increasing anti-NGO legal barriers, in particular, barriers to advocacy, decreases the amount of ODA channeled to that country. Adding new restrictions on advocacy also tends to reduce the amount of contentious aid that donors allocate to those countries. In general, as the legal environment for NGOs improves, donors are more likely to engage in contentious programming focusing on elections, human rights, security, conflict resolution and prevention. These findings support recent literature that donors, in particular, democracy assistance agencies, tame their programming when confronting dictators. 

Results regarding increasing aid to foreign NGOs (rather than domestic NGOs) in the face of legal restrictions remain inconclusive. In some cases, barriers to funding actually increase aid to domestic NGOs. However, this finding is based on limited data by USAID for a little over a decade. This finding also reflects USAID's perception that increasing assistance to respected local NGOs can help the regulatory environment from worsening, as these local NGOs can help both diplomatic and lobbying efforts, as well as spark domestic outrage against restrictive legislation. Finally, we did not find any support for our hypothesis that in response to restrictive environments for NGOs, donors may channel more funds to neighboring countries so that besieged groups can run operations from those territories. 

Our findings, especially for the amounts of aid and contentiousness of its purpose, have four main implications not just for donors, but for the operation of domestic NGOs and the sustainability of the civil society sector in the Global South. First, to overcome problems associated with the lack of external funding, local NGOs may now need to locate their headquarters outside their repressive states. Though this paper fails to find any systematic effects of the reduction of aid on the choice to operate from neighboring countries, anecdotal evidence suggests that such efforts have been undertaken. These efforts may increase with time as local NGOs start to systematically respond to reduction in aid. 

Second, the muted response from the international community may decrease local NGO trust in the donor community. For instance, after Ethiopia's 2009 Charities and Societies Proclamation, which shut down nearly all of the country's human rights NGOs [@DPR2015], the international response has been one of caution. Official statements from the US and the European Union have been heavily criticized as "timid" and "unprincipled" [@HRW2009]. However, if restrictive regulatory environments make it too hard for Northern groups and states to fund organizations in the Global South, especially those working on contentious issues, will local philanthropy grow to fill the gap? 

Third, and related, local NGOs may need to invest in resources and manpower to mobilize local resources. Previous scholarly and practitioner work has emphasized that many NGOs have increasingly hired employees and devoted more resources to win foreign grants and contracts. Aside from debating the potential adverse effects of such competition and professionalization on the nature of work undertaken by NGOs, it may the case that such practices may not neatly carry over in attempting to procure funding domestically.

Finally, a reduction in the amounts and type of aid from the international community to NGOs can also result in positive or unintended consequences. Pallas and Nguyen (2017), analyzing the reasons behind the success of Vietnamese NGOs working in the HIV/AIDS sector, argue that one of the reasons local NGOs have been so successful is due to their scarcity. Due to government restrictions on NGO formation, local groups have enhanced their negotiating power owing to their relative scarcity. Thus, it may be the case that under some circumstance, regulatory crackdown on NGOs may even have some unintended desirable consequences. 

While we have outlined some of the broad strategies that donors have undertaken in response to restrictive NGO legislation, these are by no means an exhaustive list of strategies. Funders may also undertake a number of other approaches such as increasing availability of emergency funds for recipients facing restrictions or exploring new partnerships with international business actors [@Carothers:2015]—strategies that are not testable in a cross-national approach. However, future qualitative work looking at these approaches can both examine a wider range of such strategies and determine their effectiveness.
