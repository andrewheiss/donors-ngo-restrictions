## Abstract

The last two decades have seen a proliferation of laws restricting NGOs throughout the world, resulting in an increasingly closed space for civil society. This crackdown on NGOs has been particularly acute in the Global South where states have imposed ever stricter regulations on foreign and domestic organizations. An emerging literature now looks at the conditions under which states restrict NGOs, but comparatively little is known about how Northern states and private donors have responded to this backlash against global civil society. Do trends in global philanthropy reflect donor responses to the legal repression of NGOs in the South? Have donors reduced their funding for NGOs working on politically sensitive programming in more restrictive countries? What is the effect of civil society restrictions on foreign aid?

In this paper we build on previous work by Carothers (2015), Dietrich (2016), Büthe, Major, and de Mello e Souza (2012), and Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash (2014) to investigate the relationship between Northern donors and Southern NGO regulations, combining data on global aid flows with data on civil society restrictions. Our findings ultimately have important implications for the sustainability of the NGO sector in the South and the future of assistance to civil society.
