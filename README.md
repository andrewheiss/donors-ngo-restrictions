## Abstract

The last two decades have seen a proliferation of laws restricting NGOs throughout the world, resulting in an increasingly closed space for civil society. This crackdown on NGOs has been particularly acute in the Global South where states have imposed ever stricter regulations on foreign and domestic organizations. What is the effect of civil society restrictions on overall amounts of foreign aid, the targets of aid, and the nature of issues being funded? Looking at 148 countries from 1981–2013, we find we find that increasing anti-NGO legal barriers, in particular, barriers to advocacy, decreases the amount of foreign channeled to that country. Adding new restrictions on advocacy also tends to reduce the amount of contentious aid that donors allocate to those countries. In general, as the legal environment for NGOs improves, donors are more likely to engage in contentious programming. Finally, we find that additional barriers to funding actually leads USAID to grant more aid to domestic NGOs in restrictive countries. Our findings have strong implications not just for donors, but for the operation of domestic NGOs across the Global South and the sustainability of the civil society sector in these regions.
